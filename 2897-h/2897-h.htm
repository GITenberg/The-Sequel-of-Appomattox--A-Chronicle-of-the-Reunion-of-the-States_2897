		<p class="chaptertitle">The Aftermath of War</p>

    <p class="noindent">
    <span class="first-word">When</span>
      the armies of the Union and of the Confederacy were disbanded in
      1865, two matters had been settled beyond further dispute: the negro was
      to be free, and the Union was to be perpetuated. But though slavery and
      state sovereignty were no longer at issue, there were still many problems
      which pressed for solution. The huge task of reconstruction must be faced.
      The nature of the situation required that the measures of reconstruction
      be first formulated in Washington by the victors and then worked out in
      the conquered South. Since the success of these policies would depend in a
      large measure upon their acceptability to both sections of the country, it
      was expected that the North would be influenced to some extent
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_002" id="Page_002">2</a></span>
			by the
      attitude of the Southern people, which in turn would be determined largely
      by local conditions in the South. The situation in the South at the close
      of the Civil War is therefore the point at which this narrative of the
      reconstruction naturally takes its beginning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surviving Confederate soldiers came straggling back to communities
      which were now far from being satisfactory dwelling places for civilized
      people. Everywhere they found missing many of the best of their former
      neighbors. They found property destroyed, the labor system disorganized,
      and the inhabitants in many places suffering from want. They found the
      white people demoralized and sometimes divided among themselves, and the
      negroes free, bewildered, and disorderly, for organized government had
      lapsed with the surrender of the Confederate armies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beneath a disorganized society lay a devastated land. The destruction of
      property affected all classes of the population. The accumulated capital
      of the South had disappeared in worthless Confederate stocks, bonds, and
      currency. The banks had failed early in the war. Two billion dollars
      invested in slaves had been wiped out. Factories which had been running
      before the war, or
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_003" id="Page_003">3</a></span>
		  were developed after 1861 in order to supply the
      blockaded country, had been destroyed by Federal raiders or seized and
      sold or dismantled because they had furnished supplies to the Confederacy.
      Mining industries were paralyzed. Public buildings which had been used for
      war purposes were destroyed or confiscated for the uses of the army or for
      the new freedmen's schools. It was months before courthouses, state
      capitols, school and college buildings were again made available for
      normal uses. The military school buildings had been destroyed by the
      Federal forces. Among the schools which suffered were the Virginia
      Military Institute, the University of Alabama, the Louisiana State
      Seminary, and many smaller institutions. Nearly all these had been used in
      some way for war purposes and were therefore subject to destruction or
      confiscation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The farmers and planters found themselves "land poor." The soil remained,
      but there was a prevalent lack of labor, of agricultural equipment, of
      farm stock, of seeds, and of money with which to make good the deficiency.
      As a result, a man with hundreds of acres might be as poor as a negro
      refugee. The desolation is thus described by a Virginia farmer:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_004" id="Page_004">4</a></span>
      From Harper's Ferry to New Market, which is about eighty miles &hellip; the
      country was almost a desert.&hellip; We had no cattle, hogs, sheep, or horse or
      anything else. The fences were all gone. Some of the orchards were very
      much injured, but the fruit trees had not been destroyed. The barns were
      all burned; chimneys standing without houses, and houses standing without
      roof, or door, or window.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      Much land was thrown on the market at low prices&mdash;three to five
      dollars an acre for land worth fifty dollars. The poorer lands could not
      be sold at all, and thousands of farms were deserted by their owners.
      Everywhere recovery from this agricultural depression was slow. Five years
      after the war Robert Somers, an English traveler, said of the Tennessee
      Valley:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      It consists for the most part of plantations in a state of semi-ruin and
      plantations of which the ruin is for the present total and complete.&hellip;
      The trail of war is visible throughout the valley in burnt-up gin-houses,
      ruined bridges, mills, and factories &hellip; and in large tracts of once
      cultivated land stripped of every vestige of fencing. The roads, long
      neglected, are in disorder, and having in many places become impassable,
      new tracks have been made through the woods and fields without much
      respect to boundaries.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Similar conditions existed wherever the armies had passed, and not in the
      country districts alone.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_005" id="Page_005">5</a></span>
			Many of the cities, such as Richmond, Charleston,
      Columbia, Jackson, Atlanta, and Mobile had suffered from fire or
      bombardment.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were few stocks of merchandise in the South when the war ended, and
      Northern creditors had lost so heavily through the failure of Southern
      merchants that they were cautious about extending credit again. Long
      before 1865 all coin had been sent out in contraband trade through the
      blockade. That there was a great need of supplies from the outside world
      is shown by the following statement of General Boynton:
    </p>
		<blockquote>

      This poverty was prolonged and rendered more acute by the lack of
      transportation. Horses, mules, wagons, and carriages were scarce, the
      country roads were nearly impassable, and bridges were in bad repair or
      had been burned or washed away. Steamboats had almost disappeared from the
      rivers. Those which had escaped capture as blockade runners had been
      subsequently destroyed or were worn out. Postal facilities, which had
      been poor enough during the last year of the Confederacy, were entirely
      lacking for several months after the surrender.
    </p>
    <p>
      The railways were in a state of physical dilapidation little removed from
      destruction, save for those that had been captured and kept in partial
      repair by the Federal troops. The rolling stock had been lost by capture,
      by destruction to prevent capture, in wrecks, which were frequent, or had
      been worn out. The railroad companies possessed large sums in Confederate
      currency and in securities which were now valueless. About two-thirds of
      all the lines were hopelessly bankrupt. Fortunately, the United States War
      Department took over the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_007" id="Page_007">7</a></span>
			control of the railway lines and in some cases
      effected a temporary reorganization which could not have been accomplished
      by the bankrupt companies. During the summer and fall of 1865 "loyal"
      boards of directors were appointed for most of the roads, and the army
      withdrew its control. But repairs and reconstruction were accomplished
      with difficulty because of the demoralization of labor and the lack of
      funds or credit. Freight was scarce and, had it not been for government
      shipments, some of the railroads would have been abandoned. Not many
      people were able to travel. It is recorded that on one trip from
      Montgomery to Mobile and return, a distance of 360 miles, the railroad
      which is now the Louisville and Nashville collected only thirteen dollars
      in fares.

      Had there been unrestricted commercial freedom in the South in 1865-66,
      the distress of the people would have been somewhat lessened, for here and
      there were to be found public and private stores of cotton, tobacco, rice,
      and other farm products, all of which were bringing high prices in the
      market. But for several months the operation of wartime laws and
      regulations hindered the distribution of even these scanty stores.
      Property upon which the Confederate Government had a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_008" id="Page_008">8</a></span>
			claim was of course subject to confiscation, and private property offered
			for sale, even that of Unionists, was subject to a 25 per cent tax on
			sales, a shipping tax, and a revenue tax. The revenue tax on cotton,
			ranging from two to three cents a pound during the three years after
			the war, brought in over $68,000,000. This tax, with other Federal
			revenues, yielded much more than the entire expenses of reconstruction
			from 1865 to 1868 and of all relief measures for the South, both public
			and private. After May, 1865, the 25 per cent tax was imposed only upon
			the produce of slave labor. None of the war taxes, except that on
			cotton, was levied upon the crops of 1866, but while these taxes lasted
			they seriously impeded the resumption of trade.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even these restrictions, however, might have been borne if only they had
      been honestly applied. Unfortunately, some of the most spectacular frauds
      ever perpetrated were carried through in connection with the attempt of
      the United States Treasury Department to collect and sell the confiscable
      property in the South. The property to be sold consisted of what had been
      captured and seized by the army and the navy, of "abandoned" property, as
      such was called whose owner
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_009" id="Page_009">9</a></span>
			was absent in the Confederate service, and of property subject to seizure
			under the confiscation acts of Congress. No captures were made after the
			general surrender, and no further seizures of "abandoned" property were
			made after Johnson's amnesty proclamation of May 29, 1865. This left only
			the "confiscable" property to be collected and sold.
    </p>
    <p>
      For collection purposes the States of the South were divided into
      districts, each under the supervision of an agent of the Treasury
      Department, who received a commission of about 25 per cent. Cotton,
      regarded as the root of the slavery evil, was singled out as the principal
      object of confiscation. It was known that the Confederate Government had
      owned in 1865 about 150,000 bales, but the records were defective and much
      of it, with no clear indication of ownership, still remained with the
      producers. Secretary Chase, foreseeing the difficulty of effecting a just
      settlement, counseled against seizure, but his judgment was overruled.
      Secretary McCulloch said of his agents: "I am sure I sent some honest
      cotton agents South; but it sometimes seems doubtful whether any of them
      remained honest very long." Some of the natives, even, became cotton
      thieves. In a report made in 1866, McCulloch describes their methods:
		</p>
		<blockquote>
		<p class="noindent">
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_010" id="Page_010">10</a></span>
      Contractors, anxious for gain, were sometimes guilty of bad faith and
      peculation, and frequently took possession of cotton and delivered it
      under contracts as captured or abandoned, when in fact it was not such,
      and they had no right to touch it.&hellip; Residents and others in the
      districts where these peculations were going on took advantage of the
      unsettled condition of the country, and representing themselves as agents
      of this department, went about robbing under such pretended authority, and
      thus added to the difficulties of the situation by causing unjust
      opprobrium and suspicion to rest upon officers engaged in the faithful
      discharge of their duties. Agents, &hellip; frequently received or collected
      property, and sent it forward which the law did not authorize them to
      take.&hellip; Lawless men, singly and in organized bands, engaged in general
      plunder; every species of intrigue and peculation and theft were resorted
      to.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      These agents turned over to the United States about $34,000,000. About
      40,000 claimants were subsequently indemnified on the ground that the
      property taken from them did not belong to the Confederate Government, but
      many thousands of other claimants have been unable to prove that their
      property was seized by government agents and hence have received nothing.
      It is probable that the actual Confederate property was nearly all stolen
      by the agents. One agent in Alabama sold an appointment as assistant for
      $25,000, and a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_011" id="Page_011">11</a></span>
			few months later both the assistant and the agent were
      tried by a military court for stealing and were fined $90,000 and $250,000
      respectively in addition to being imprisoned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other property, including horses, mules, wagons, tobacco, rice, and sugar
      which the natives claimed as their own, was seized. In some places the
      agents even collected delinquent Confederate taxes. Much of the
      confiscable property was not sold but was turned over to the Freedmen's
      Bureau &sup1; for its support. The total amount seized cannot be
			satisfactorily ascertained. The Ku Klux minority report asserted that
			3,000,000 bales of cotton were taken, of which the United States received
			only 114,000. It is certain that, owing to the deliberate destruction of
			cotton by fire in 1864-65, this estimate was too high, but all the
			testimony points to the fact that the frauds were stupendous. As a result
			the United States Government did not succeed in obtaining the Confederate
		  property to which it had a claim, and the country itself was stripped of
			necessities to a degree that left it not only destitute but outraged and
			embittered. "Such practices," said Trowbridge, "had a pernicious effect,
			engendering a contempt for the Government and a murderous
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_012" id="Page_012">12</a></span>
			ill-will which too commonly vented itself upon soldiers and negroes."

      The South faced the work of reconstruction not only with a shortage of
      material and greatly hampered in the employment even of that but still
      more with a shortage of men. The losses among the whites are usually
      estimated at about half the military population, but since accurate
      records are lacking the exact numbers cannot be ascertained. The best of
      the civil leaders, as well as the prominent military leaders, had so
      committed themselves to the support of the Confederacy as to be excluded
      from participation in any reconstruction that might be attempted. The
      business of reconstruction, therefore, fell of necessity to the
      Confederate private soldiers, the lower officers, nonparticipants, and
      lukewarm individuals who had not greatly compromised themselves. These
      politically and physically uninjured survivors included also all the
      "slackers" of the Confederacy. But though there were such physical and
      moral losses on the part of those to whom fell the direction of affairs
      there was also a moral strengthening in the sound element of the people
      who had been tried by the discipline of war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The greatest weakness of both races was their
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_013" id="Page_013">13</a></span>
			extreme poverty. The crops of 1865 turned out badly, for most of the
			soldiers reached home too late for successful planting and the negro
			labor was not dependable. The sale of such cotton and farm products as
			had escaped the treasury agents was of some help, but curiously enough
			much of the good money thus obtained was spent extravagantly by a people
			used to Confederate rag money and for four years deprived of the luxuries
			of life. The poorer whites who had lost all were close to starvation. In
			the white counties which had sent so large a proportion of men to the
			army the destitution was most acute. In many families the breadwinner
			had been killed in war. After 1862 relief systems had been organized in
			nearly all the Confederate States for the purpose of aiding the poor
			whites, but these organizations were disbanded in 1865. A Freedmen's
			Bureau official traveling through the desolate back country furnishes a
			description which might have applied to two hundred counties, a third
			of the South: "It is a common, an every-day sight in Randolph County,
			that of women and children, most of whom were formerly in good
			circumstances, begging for bread from door to door. Meat of any kind
      has been a stranger to many of their mouths
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_014" id="Page_014">14</a></span>
			for months. The drought cut off what little crops they hoped to save,
			and they must have immediate help or perish. By far the greater
			suffering exists among the whites. Their scanty supplies have been
			exhausted, and now they look to the Government alone for support.
			Some are without homes of any description."
    </p>
    <p>
      Where the armies had passed, few of the people, white or black, remained;
      most of them had been forced as "refugees" within the Union lines or into
      the interior of the Confederacy. Now, along with the disbanded Confederate
      soldiers, they came straggling back to their war-swept homes. It was
      estimated, in December, 1865 that in the States of Alabama, Mississippi,
      and Georgia, there were five hundred thousand white people who were
      without the necessaries of life; numbers died from lack of food. Within a
      few months relief agencies were at work. In the North, especially in the
      border States and in New York, charitable organizations collected and
      forwarded great quantities of supplies to the negroes and to the whites in
      the hill and mountain counties. The reorganized state and local
      governments sent food from the unravaged portions of the Black Belt to the
      nearest white counties, and the army commanders gave some
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_015" id="Page_015">15</a></span>
			aid. As soon as the Freedmen's Bureau was organized, it fed to the limit
			of its supplies the needy whites as well as the blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The extent of the relief afforded by the charity of the North and by the
      agencies of the United States Government is not now generally remembered,
      probably on account of the later objectionable activities of the
      Freedmen's Bureau, but it was at the time properly appreciated. A Southern
      journalist, writing of what he saw in Georgia, remarked that "it must be a
      matter of gratitude as well as surprise for our people to see a Government
      which was lately fighting us with fire and sword and shell, now generously
      feeding our poor and distressed. In the immense crowds which throng the
      distributing house, I notice the mothers and fathers, widows and orphans
      of our soldiers.&hellip; Again, the Confederate soldier, with one leg or
			one arm, the crippled, maimed, and broken, and the worn and destitute men,
			who fought bravely their enemies then, their benefactors now, have their
			sacks filled and are fed."
    </p>
    <p>
      Acute distress continued until 1867; after that year there was no further
      danger of starvation. Some of the poor whites, especially in the remote
      districts, never again reached a comfortable standard
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_016" id="Page_016">16</a></span>
			of living; some were demoralized by too much assistance; others were
			discouraged and left the South for the West or the North. But the mass
			of the people accepted the discipline of poverty and made the best of
			their situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difficulties, however, that beset even the courageous and the
      competent were enormous. The general paralysis of industry, the breaking
      up of society, and poverty on all sides bore especially hard on those who
      had not previously been manual laborers. Physicians could get practice
      enough but no fees; lawyers who had supported the Confederacy found it
      difficult to get back into the reorganized courts because of the test
      oaths and the competition of "loyal" attorneys; and for the teachers there
      were few schools. We read of officers high in the Confederate service
      selling to Federal soldiers the pies and cakes cooked by their wives, of
      others selling fish and oysters which they themselves had caught, and of
      men and women hitching themselves to plows when they had no horse or mule.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such incidents must, from their nature, have been infrequent, but they
      show to what straits some at least were reduced. Six years after the war,
      James S. Pike, then in South Carolina,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_017" id="Page_017">17</a></span>
			mentions cases which might be duplicated in nearly every old Southern
			community: "In the vicinity," he says, "lived a gentleman whose income
			when the war broke out was rated at $150,000 a year. Not a vestige of
			his whole vast estate remains today. Not far distant were the estates
			of a large proprietor and a well known family, rich and distinguished
			for generations. The slaves were gone. The family is gone. A single
			scion of the house remains, and he peddles tea by the pound and
			molasses by the quart, on a corner of the old homestead, to the
      former slaves of the family and thereby earns his livelihood."
    </p>
    <p>
      General Lee's good example influenced many. Commercial enterprises were
      willing to pay for the use of his name and reputation, but he wished to
      farm and could get no opportunity. "They are offering my father
      everything," his daughter said, "except the only thing he will accept, a
      place to earn honest bread while engaged in some useful work." This remark
      led to an offer of the presidency of Washington College, now Washington
      and Lee University, which he accepted. "I have a self-imposed task which I
      must accomplish," he said, "I have led the young men of the South in
      battle; I have seen many of them fall under my
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_018" id="Page_018">18</a></span>
			standard. I shall devote my life now to training young men to do their
			duty in life."
    </p>
    <p>
      The condition of honest folk was still further troubled by a general
      spirit of lawlessness in many regions. Virginia, Tennessee, Arkansas, and
      Louisiana recognized the "Union" state government, but the coming of peace
      brought legal anarchy to the other States of the Confederacy. The
      Confederate state and local governments were abolished as the armies of
      occupation spread over the South, and for a period of four or six months
      there was no government except that exercised by the commanders of the
      military garrisons left behind when the armies marched away. Even before
      the surrender the local governments were unable to make their authority
      respected, and soon after the war ended parts of the country became
      infested with outlaws, pretend treasury agents, horse thieves, cattle
      thieves, and deserters. Away from the military posts only lynch law could
      cope with these elements of disorder. With the aid of the army in the
			more settled regions, and by extra-legal means elsewhere, the outlaws,
			thieves, cotton burners, and house burners were brought somewhat under
			control even before the state governments were reorganized, though the
			embers of lawlessness continued to smolder.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_019" id="Page_019">19</a></span>
      The relations between the Federal soldiers stationed in the principal
      towns and the native white population were not, on the whole, so bad as
      might have been expected. If the commanding officer were well disposed,
      there was little danger of friction, though sometimes his troops got out
      of hand. The regulars had a better reputation than the volunteers. The
      Confederate soldiers were surfeited with fighting, but the "stay-at-home"
      element was often a cause of trouble. The problem of social relations
      between the conquerors and the conquered was troublesome. The men might
      get along well together, but the women would have nothing do with the
      "Yankees" and ill feeling arose because of their antipathy. Carl Schurz
      reported that "the soldier of the Union is looked upon as a stranger, an
      intruder, as the 'Yankee,' the 'enemy.'&hellip; The existence and
			intensity of this aversion is too well known to those who have served or
			are serving in the South to require proof."
    </p>
    <p>
      In retaliation the soldiers developed ingenious ways of annoying the
      whites. Women, forced for any reason to go to headquarters, were made to
      take the oath of allegiance or the "ironclad" oath before their requests
      were granted; flags were fastened over doors, gates, or sidewalks in order
      to
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_020" id="Page_020">20</a></span>
			irritate the recalcitrant dames and their daughters. Confederate songs
      and color combinations were forbidden. In Richmond, General Halleck
      ordered that no marriages be performed unless the bride, the groom, and
      the officiating clergyman took the oath of allegiance. He explained this
      as a measure taken to prevent "the propagation of legitimate rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      The wearing of Confederate uniforms was forbidden by military order, but
      by May, 1865, few soldiers possessed regulation uniforms. In Tennessee the
      State also imposed fines upon wearers of the uniform. In the vicinity of
			military posts buttons and marks of rank were usually ordered removed and
			the gray clothes dyed with some other color. General Lee, for example,
			had the buttons on his coat covered with cloth. But frequently the
			Federal commander, after issuing the orders, paid no more attention to
      the matter and such conflicts as arose on account of the uniform were
      usually caused by officious enlisted men and the negro troops. Whitelaw
      Reid relates the following incident:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Nothing was more touching, in all that I saw in Savannah, than the almost
      painful effort of the rebels, from generals down to privates, to conduct
      themselves so as to evince respect for our soldiers, and to bring no
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_021" id="Page_021">21</a></span>
      severer punishment upon the city than it had already received. There was a
      brutal scene at the hotel, where a drunken sergeant, with a pair of
      tailor's shears, insisted on cutting the buttons from the uniform of an
      elegant gray-headed old brigadier, who had just come in from Johnston's
      army; but he bore himself modestly and very handsomely through it. His
      staff was composed of fine-looking, stalwart fellows, evidently gentlemen,
      who appeared intensely mortified at such treatment. They had no clothes
      except their rebel uniforms, and had, as yet, had no time to procure
      others, but they avoided disturbances and submitted to what they might,
      with some propriety, and with the general approval of our officers, have
      resented.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The negro troops, even at their best, were everywhere considered offensive
      by the native whites. General Grant, indeed, urged that only white troops
      be used to garrison the interior. But the negro soldier, impudent by
      reason of his new freedom, his new uniform, and his new gun, was more than
      Southern temper could tranquilly bear, and race conflicts were frequent. A
      New Orleans newspaper thus states the Southern point of view: "Our
      citizens who had been accustomed to meet and treat the negroes only as
      respectful servants, were mortified, pained, and shocked to encounter
      them &hellip; wearing Federal uniforms and bearing bright muskets and gleaming
      bayonets.&hellip; They
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_022" id="Page_022">22</a></span>
			are jostled from the sidewalks by dusky guards, marching
      four abreast. They were halted, in rude and sullen tones, by negro
      sentinels."
    </p>
    <p>
      The task of the Federal forces was not easy. The garrisons were not large
      enough nor numerous enough to keep order in the absence of civil
      government. The commanders in the South asked in vain for cavalry to
      police the rural districts. Much of the disorder, violence, and
      incendiarism attributed at the time to lawless soldiers appeared later to
      be due to discharged soldiers and others pretending to be soldiers in
      order to carry out schemes of robbery. The whites complained vigorously of
      the garrisons, and petitions were sent to Washington from mass meetings
      and from state legislatures asking for their removal. The higher
      commanders, however, bore themselves well, and in a few fortunate cases
      Southern whites were on most amicable terms with the garrison commanders.
      The correspondence of responsible military officers in the South shows how
      earnestly and considerately each, as a rule, tried to work out his task.
      The good sense of most of the Federal officers appeared when, after the
      murder of Lincoln, even General Grant for a brief space lost his head and
      ordered the arrest of paroled Confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_023" id="Page_023">23</a></span>
      The church organizations were as much involved in the war and in the
      reconstruction as were secular institutions. Before the war every
      religious organization having members North and South, except the Catholic
      Church and the Jews, had separated into independent Northern and Southern
      bodies. In each section church feeling ran high, and when the war came
      the churches supported the armies. As the Federal armies occupied Southern
      territory, the church buildings of each denomination were turned over to
      the corresponding Northern body, and Southern ministers were permitted to
      remain only upon agreeing to conduct "loyal services, pray for the
      President of the United States and for Federal victories" and to foster
      "loyal sentiment." The Protestant Episcopal churches in Alabama were
      closed from September to December, 1865, and some congregations were
      dispersed by the soldiers because Bishop Wilmer had directed his clergy to
      omit the prayer for President Davis but had substituted no other. The
      ministers of non-liturgical churches were not so easily controlled. A
      Georgia Methodist preacher directed by a Federal officer to pray for the
      President said afterwards: "I prayed for the President that the Lord would
      take out of him
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_024" id="Page_024">24</a></span>
			and his allies the hearts of beasts and put into them the
      hearts of men or remove the cusses from office." Sometimes members of a
      congregation showed their resentment at the "loyal" prayers by leaving the
      church. But in spite of many irritations both sides frequently managed to
      get some amusement out of the "loyal" services. The church situation was,
      however, a serious matter during and after the reconstruction, and some of
      its later phases will have to be discussed elsewhere.

      The Unionist, or "Tory," of the lower and eastern South found himself, in
      1865, a man without a country. Few in number in any community, they found
      themselves upon their return from a harsh exile the victims of ostracism
      or open hostility. One of them, William H. Smith, later Governor of
      Alabama, testified that the Southern people "manifest the most perfect
      contempt for a man who is known to be an unequivocal Union man; they call
      him a 'galvanized Yankee' and apply other terms and epithets to him."
      General George H. Thomas, speaking of a region more divided in sentiment
      than Alabama, remarked that "Middle Tennessee is disturbed by animosities
      and hatreds, much more than it is by the disloyalty of persons towards the
      Government of the United States.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_025" id="Page_025">25</a></span>
			Those personal animosities would break out and overawe the civil
			authorities, but for the presence there of the troops of the United
			States.&hellip; They are more unfriendly to Union men, natives of the
			State of Tennessee, or of the South, who have been in the Union army,
			than they are to men of Northern birth."
    </p>
    <p>
      In the border States society was sharply divided and feeling was bitter.
      In eastern Tennessee, eastern Kentucky, West Virginia, and parts of
      Arkansas and Missouri returning Confederates met harsher treatment than
      did the Unionists in the lower South. Trowbridge says of east Tennessee:
      "Returning rebels were robbed; and if one had stolen unawares to his home,
      it was not safe for him to remain there. I saw in Virginia one of these
      exiles, who told me how homesickly he pined for the hills and meadows of
      east Tennessee, which he thought the most delightful region in the world.
      But there was a rope hanging from a tree for him there, and he dared not
      go back. 'The bottom rails are on top,' said he, 'that is the trouble.'
      The Union element, and the worst part of the Union element, was
      uppermost." Confederates and Confederate sympathizers in Maryland, West
      Virginia, Tennessee, and Kentucky
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_026" id="Page_026">26</a></span>
			were disfranchised. In West Virginia,
      Tennessee, and Missouri, "war trespass" suits were brought against
      returning Confederates for military acts done in war time. In Missouri and
      West Virginia strict test oaths excluded Confederates from office, from
      the polls, and from the professions of teaching, preaching, and law. On
      the other hand in central and western Kentucky the predominant Unionist
      population, themselves suffering through the abolition of slavery, and by
      the objectionable operations of the Freedmen's Bureau and the unwise
      military administration, showed more sympathy for the Confederates,
      welcomed them home, and soon relieved them of all restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another element of discord was added by the Northerners who came to
      exploit the South. Many mustered-out soldiers proposed to stay.
      Speculators of all kinds followed the withdrawing Confederate lines and
      with the conclusion of peace spread through the country; but they were not
      cordially received. With the better class, the Southerners, especially the
      soldiers, associated freely if seldom intimately. But the conduct of a few
      of their number who considered that the war had opened all doors to them,
      who very freely expressed their views, gave advice, condemned old
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_027" id="Page_027">27</a></span>
			customs, and were generally offensive, did much to bring all Northerners
		  into disrepute. Tactlessly critical letters published in Northern papers
			did not add to their popularity. The few Northern women felt the ostracism
      more keenly than did the men. Benjamin C. Truman, an agent of President
      Johnson, thus summed up the situation: "There is a prevalent disposition
      not to associate too freely with Northern men or to receive them into the
      circles of society; but it is far from unsurmountable. Over Southern
      society, as over every other, woman reigns supreme, and they are more
      embittered against those whom they deem the authors of all their
      calamities than are their brothers, sons, and husbands." But of the
      thousands of Northern men who overcame the reluctance of the Southerners
      to social intercourse little was heard. Many a Southern planter secured a
      Northern partner, or sold him half his plantation to get money to run the
      other half. For the irritations of 1865 each party must take its share of
      responsibility.

      Had the South assisted in a skillful and adequate publicity, much
      disastrous misunderstanding might have been avoided. The North knew as
      little of the South as the South did of the North, but the North was eager
      for news. Able newspaper
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_028" id="Page_028">28</a></span>
			correspondents like Sidney Andrews of the Boston <i>Advertiser</i> and
			the Chicago <i>Tribune</i>, who opposed President Johnson's policies,
			Thomas W. Knox of the New York <i>Herald</i>, who had given General
      Sherman so much trouble in Tennessee, Whitelaw Reid, who wrote for several
      papers and tried cotton planting in Louisiana, and John T. Trowbridge, New
      England author and journalist, were dispatched southwards. Chief of the
      President's investigators was General Carl Schurz, German revolutionist,
      Federal soldier, and soon to be radical Republican, who held harsh views
      of the Southern people; and there were besides Harvey M. Watterson,
      Kentucky Democrat and Unionist, the father of "Marse" Henry; Benjamin C.
      Truman, New England journalist and soldier, whose long report was perhaps
      the best of all; Chief Justice Chase, who was thinking mainly of "How soon
      can the negro vote?"; and General Grant, who made a report so brief that,
      notwithstanding its value, it attracted little attention. In addition, a
      constant stream of information and misinformation was going northward from
      treasury agents, officers of the army, the Freedmen's Bureau, teachers,
      and missionaries. Among foreigners who described the conquered land were
      Robert
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_029" id="Page_029">29</a></span>
			Somers, Henry Latham, and William Hepworth Dixon. But few in the
      South realized the importance of supplying the North with correct
      information about actual conditions. The letters and reports, they
      thought, humiliated them; inquiry was felt to be prying and gloating.
      "Correspondents have added a new pang to surrender," it was said. The
      South was proud and refused to be catechized. From the Northern point of
      view the South, a new and strange region, with strange customs and
      principles, was of course not to be considered as quite normal and
      American, but there was on the part of many correspondents a determined
      attempt to describe things as they were. And yet the North persisted in
      its unsympathetic queries when it seemed to have a sufficient answer in
      the reports of Grant, Schurz, and Truman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grant's opinion was short and direct: "I am satisfied that the mass of
      thinking men of the South accept the present situation of affairs in good
      faith.&hellip; The citizens of the Southern States are anxious to return
			to self-government within the Union as soon as possible." Truman came to
			the conclusion that "the rank and file of the disbanded Southern army
			&hellip; are the backbone and sinew of the South.&hellip; To the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_030" id="Page_030">30</a></span>
			disbanded regiments of the rebel army, both officers and men, I look with
			great confidence as the best and altogether the most hopeful element of
			the South, the real basis of reconstruction and the material of worthy
			citizenship." General John Tarbell, before the Joint Committee on
			Reconstruction, testified that "there are, no doubt, disloyal and
			disorderly persons in the South, but it is an entire mistake to apply
			these terms to a whole people. I would as soon travel alone, unarmed,
			through the South as through the North. The South I left is not at all
			the South I hear and read about in the North. From the sentiment I hear
			in the North, I would scarcely recognize the people I saw, and, except
			their politics, I liked so well. I have entire faith that the better
			classes are friendly to the negroes."
    </p>
    <p>
      Carl Schurz on the other hand was not so favorably impressed. "The loyalty
      of the masses and most of the leaders of the southern people," he said,
      "consists in submission to necessity. There is, except in individual
      instances, an entire absence of that national spirit which forms the basis
      of true loyalty and patriotism." Another government official in Florida
      was quite doubtful of the Southern whites. "I would pin them down at the
      point
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_031" id="Page_031">31</a></span>
			of the bayonet," he declared, "so close that they would not have room to
			wiggle, and allow intelligent colored people to go up and vote in
			preference to them. The only Union element in the South proper &hellip;
			is among the colored people. The whites will treat you very kindly to
			your face, but they are deceitful. I have often thought, and so expressed
			myself, that there is so much deception among the people of the South
			since the rebellion, that if an earthquake should open and swallow them
			up, I was fearful that the devil would be dethroned and some of them
			take his place."
    </p>
    <p>
      The point of view of the Confederate military leaders was exhibited by
      General Wade Hampton in a letter to President Johnson and by General Lee
      in his advice to Governor Letcher of Virginia. General Hampton wrote: "The
      South unequivocally 'accepts the situation' in which she is placed.
      Everything that she has done has been done in perfect faith, and in the
      true and highest sense of the word, she is loyal. By this I mean that she
      intends to abide by the laws of the land honestly, to fulfill all her
      obligations faithfully and to keep her word sacredly, and I assert that
      the North has no right to demand more of her. You have no right to ask, or
      expect that she will at once profess
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_032" id="Page_032">32</a></span>
			unbounded love to that Union from which for four years she tried to
			escape at the cost of her best blood and all her treasures." General Lee
			in order to set an example applied through General Grant for a pardon
			under the amnesty proclamation and soon afterwards he wrote to Governor
			Letcher: "All should unite in honest efforts to obliterate the effects
			of war, and to restore the blessings of peace. They should remain, if
			possible, in the country; promote harmony and good-feeling; qualify
			themselves to vote; and elect to the State and general legislatures wise
			and patriotic men, who will devote their abilities to the interests of
			the country and the healing of all dissensions; I have invariably
			recommended this course since the cessation of hostilities, and have
			endeavored to practice it myself."

      Southerners of the Confederacy everywhere, then, accepted the destruction
      of slavery and the renunciation of state sovereignty; they welcomed an
      early restoration of the Union, without any punishment of leaders of the
      defeated cause. But they were proud of their Confederate records though
      now legally "loyal" to the United States; they considered the negro as
      free but inferior, and expected to be permitted to fix his status in the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_033" id="Page_033">33</a></span>
			social organization and to solve the problem of free labor in their own
      way. To embarrass the easy and permanent realization of these views there
      was a society disrupted, economically prostrate, deprived of its natural
      leaders, subjected to a control not always wisely conceived nor
      effectively exercised, and, finally, containing within its own population
      unassimilated elements which presented problems fraught with difficulty
      and danger.

      negro is the central figure in the reconstruction of the South.
      Without the negro there would have been no Civil War. Granting a war
      fought for any other cause, the task of reconstruction would, without him,
      have been comparatively simple. With him, however, reconstruction meant
      more than the restoring of shattered resources; it meant the more or less
      successful attempt to obtain and secure for the freedman civil and
      political rights, and to improve his economic and social status. In 1861
      the American negro was everywhere an inferior, and most of his race were
      slaves; in 1865 he was no longer a slave, but whether he was to be serf,
      ward, or citizen was an unsettled problem; in 1868 he was in the South
      the legal and political equal, frequently the superior, of the white; and
      before the end of the reconstruction period he was made by the legislation
      of some
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_035" id="Page_035">35</a></span>
			States and by Congress the legal equal of the white even in
      certain social matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      The race problem which confronted the American people had no parallel in
      the past. British and Spanish-American emancipation of slaves had affected
      only small numbers or small regions, in which one race greatly outnumbered
      the other. The results of these earlier emancipations of the negroes and
      the difficulties of European states in dealing with subject white
      populations were not such as to afford helpful example to American
      statesmen. But since it was the actual situation in the Southern States
      rather than the experience of other countries which shaped the policies
      adopted during reconstruction, it is important to examine with some care
      the conditions in which the negroes in the South found themselves at the
      close of the war.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negroes were not all helpless and without experience "when freedom
      cried out." &sup1; In the Border States and in the North there were, in 1861,
      half a million free negroes accustomed to looking out for themselves.
      Nearly 200,000 negro men were enlisted in the United States army between
      1862 and 1865, and many thousands of slaves had followed raiding Federal
      forces to freedom or had
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_036" id="Page_036">36</a></span>
			escaped through the Confederate lines. State
      emancipation in Missouri, Maryland, West Virginia, and Tennessee, and the
      practical application of the Emancipation Proclamation where the Union
      armies were in control ended slavery for many thousands more. Wherever the
      armies marched, slavery ended. This was true even in Kentucky, where the
      institution was not legally abolished until the adoption of the Thirteenth
      Amendment. Altogether more than a million negroes were free and to some
      extent habituated to freedom before May, 1865.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_02-1" name="footer_02-1"></a>
&sup1; A negro phrase much used in referring to emancipation.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      Most of these war-emancipated negroes were scattered along the borders of
      the Confederacy, in camps, in colonies, in the towns, on refugee farms, at
      work with the armies, or serving as soldiers in the ranks. There were
      large working colonies along the Atlantic coast from Maryland to Florida.
      The chief centers were near Norfolk, where General Butler was the first to
      establish a "contraband" camp, in North Carolina, and on the Sea Islands
      of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, which had been seized by the
      Federal fleet early in the war. To the Sea Islands also were sent, in
      1865, the hordes of negroes who had followed General Sherman out of
      Georgia and South Carolina. Through
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_037" id="Page_037">37</a></span>
			the Border States from the Atlantic to the Mississippi and along both
			sides of the Mississippi from Cairo, Illinois, to New Orleans, there
			were other refugee camps, farms, and colonies. For periods varying
			from one to four years these free negroes had been at work, often amid
			conditions highly unfavorable to health, under the supervision of
			officers of the Treasury Department or of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      Emancipation was therefore a gradual process, and most of the negroes,
      through their widening experience on the plantations, with the armies, and
      in the colonies, were better fitted for freedom in 1865 than they had been
      in 1861. Even their years of bondage had done something for them, for they
      knew how to work and they had adopted in part the language, habits,
      religion, and morals of the whites. But slavery had not made them thrifty,
      self-reliant, or educated. Frederick Douglass said of the negro at the end
      of his servitude: "He had none of the conditions of self-preservation or
      self-protection. He was free from the individual master, but he had
      nothing but the dusty road under his feet. He was free from the old
      quarter that once gave him shelter, but a slave to the rains of summer and
      to the frosts of winter. He was turned loose, naked, hungry, and destitute
      to the open sky."
	 </p>
	 <p>
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_038" id="Page_038">38</a></span>
			To prove that he was free the negro thought he must
      leave his old master, change his name, quit work for a time, perhaps get a
      new wife, and hang around the Federal soldiers in camp or garrison, or go
      to the towns where the Freedmen's Bureau was in process of organization.
      To the negroes who remained at home&mdash;and, curiously enough, for a
      time at least many did so&mdash;the news of freedom was made known
      somewhat ceremonially by the master or his representative. The negroes
      were summoned to the "big house," told that they were free, and advised to
      stay on for a share of the crop. The description by Mrs. Clayton, the wife
      of a Southern general, will serve for many: "My husband said, 'I think it
      best for me to inform our negroes of their freedom.' So he ordered all the
      grown slaves to come to him, and told them they no longer belonged to him
      as property, but were all free. 'You are not bound to remain with me any
      longer, and I have a proposition to make to you. If any of you desire to
      leave, I propose to furnish you with a conveyance to move you, and with
      provisions for the balance of the year.' The universal answer was,
      'Master, we want to stay right here with you.' In many instances the
      slaves were so infatuated with the idea of being, as they said,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_039" id="Page_039">39</a></span>
			'free as birds' that they left their homes and consequently suffered;
			but our slaves were not so foolish." &sup1;
    </p>

&sup1; <i>Black and White under the Old R&eacute;gime</i>, p. 152,</p>
</div>
    <p>
      The negroes, however, had learned of their freedom before their old
      masters returned from the war; they were aware that the issues of the war
      involved in some way the question of their freedom or servitude, and
      through the "grape vine telegraph," the news brought by the invading
      soldiers, and the talk among the whites, they had long been kept fairly
      well informed. What the idea of freedom meant to the negroes it is
      difficult to say. Some thought that there would be no more work and that
      all would be cared for by the Government; others believed that education
      and opportunity were about to make them the equal of their masters. The
      majority of them were too bewildered to appreciate anything except the
      fact that they were free from enforced labor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conditions were most disturbed in the so-called "Black Belt," consisting
      of about two hundred counties in the most fertile parts of the South,
      where the plantation system was best developed and where by far the
      majority of the negroes were segregated. The negroes in the four hundred
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_040" id="Page_040">40</a></span>
      more remote and less fertile "white" counties, which had been less
      disturbed by armies, were not so upset by freedom as those of the Black
      Belt, for the garrisons and the larger towns, both centers of
      demoralization, were in or near the Black Belt. But there was a moving to
      and fro on the part of those who had escaped from the South or had been
      captured during the war or carried into the interior of the South to
      prevent capture. To those who left slavery and home to find freedom were
      added those who had found freedom and were now trying to get back home or
      to get away from the negro camps and colonies which were breaking up. A
      stream of immigration which began to flow to the southwest affected
      negroes as far as the Atlantic coast. In the confusion of moving, families
      were broken up, and children, wife, or husband were often lost to one
      another. The very old people and the young children were often left behind
      for the former master to care for. Regiments of negro soldiers were
      mustered out in every large town and their numbers were added to the
      disorderly mass. Some of the Federal garrisons and Bureau stations were
      almost overwhelmed by the numbers of blacks who settled down upon them
      waiting for freedom to bestow its full measure
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_041" id="Page_041">41</a></span>
			of blessing, and many of the negroes continued to remain in a
			demoralized condition until the new year.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first year of freedom was indeed a year of disease, suffering, and
      death. Several partial censuses indicate that in 1865-66 the negro
      population lost as many by disease as the whites had lost in war. Ill-fed,
      crowded in cabins near the garrisons or entirely without shelter, and
      unaccustomed to caring for their own health, the blacks who were searching
      for freedom fell an easy prey to ordinary diseases and to epidemics. Poor
      health conditions prevailed for several years longer. In 1870 Robert
      Somers remarked that "the health of the whites has greatly improved since
      the war, while the health of the negroes has declined till the mortality
      of the colored population, greater than the mortality of the whites was
      before the war, has now become so markedly greater, that nearly two
      colored die for every white person out of equal numbers of each."
    </p>
    <p>
      Morals and manners also suffered under the new dispensation. In the
      crowded and disease-stricken towns and camps, the conditions under which
      the roving negroes lived were no better for morals than for health, for
      here there were none of the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_042" id="Page_042">42</a></span>
			restraints to which the blacks had been
      accustomed and which they now despised as being a part of their servitude.
      But in spite of all the relief that could be given there was much want. In
      fact, to restore former conditions the relief agencies frequently cut off
      supplies in order to force the negroes back to work and to prevent others
      from leaving the country for the towns. But the hungry freedmen turned to
      the nearest food supply, and "spilin de gypshuns" (despoiling the
      Egyptians, as the negroes called stealing from the whites) became an
      approved means of support. Thefts of hogs, cattle, poultry, field crops,
      and vegetables drove almost to desperation those whites who lived in the
      vicinity of the negro camps. When the ex-slave felt obliged to go to town,
      he was likely to take with him a team and wagon and his master's clothes
      if he could get them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The former good manners of the negro were now replaced by impudence and
      distrust. There were advisers among the negro troops and other agitators
      who assured them that politeness to whites was a mark of servitude.
      Pushing and crowding in public places, on street cars and on the
      sidewalks, and impudent speeches everywhere marked generally the limit of
      rudeness. And the negroes were,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_043" id="Page_043">43</a></span>
			in this respect, perhaps no worse than
      those European immigrants who act upon the principle that bad manners are
      a proof of independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The year following emancipation was one of religious excitement for large
      numbers of the blacks. Before 1865 the negro church members were attached
      to white congregations or were organized into missions, with nearly always
      a white minister in charge and a black assistant. With the coming of
      freedom the races very soon separated in religious matters. For this there
      were two principal reasons: the negro preachers could exercise more
      influence in independent churches; and new church organizations from the
      North were seeking negro membership. Sometimes negro members were urged to
      insist on the right "to sit together" with the whites. In a Richmond
      church a negro from the street pushed his way to the communion altar and
      knelt. There was a noticeable pause; then General Robert E. Lee went
      forward and knelt beside the negro; and the congregation followed his
      example. But this was a solitary instance. When the race issue was raised
      by either color, the church membership usually divided. There was much
      churchgoing by the negroes, day and night, and church festivities and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_044" id="Page_044">44</a></span>
      baptisms were common. The blacks preferred immersion and wanted a new
      baptism each time they changed to a new church. Baptizings in ponds,
      creeks, or rivers were great occasions and were largely attended.
      "Shouting" the candidates went into the water and "shouting" they came
      out. One old woman came up screaming, "Freed from slavery! freed from sin!
      Bless God and General Grant!"
    </p>
    <p>
      In the effort to realize their new-found freedom, the negroes were heavily
      handicapped by their extreme poverty and their ignorance. The total value
      of free negro property ran up into the millions in 1860, but the majority
      of the negroes had nothing. There were a few educated negroes in the
      South, and more in the North and in Canada, but the mass of the race was
      too densely ignorant to furnish its own leadership. The case, however, was
      not hopeless; the negro was able to work and in large territories had
      little competition; wages were high, even though paid in shares of the
      crop; the cost of living was low; and land was cheap. Thousands seemed
      thirsty for an education and crowded the schools which were available. It
      was too much, however, to expect the negro to take immediate advantage of
      his opportunities. What
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_045" id="Page_045">45</a></span>
			he wanted was a long holiday, a gun and a dog, and
      plenty of hunting and fishing. He must have Saturday at least for a trip
      to town or to a picnic or a circus; he did not wish to be a servant. When
      he had any money, swindlers reaped a harvest. They sold him worthless
      finery, cheap guns, preparations to bleach the skin or straighten the
      hair, and striped pegs which, when set up on the master's plantation,
      would entitle the purchaser to "40 acres and a mule."
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude of the negroes' employers not infrequently complicated the
      situation which they sought to better. The old masters were, as a rule,
      skeptical of the value of free negro labor. Carl Schurz thought this
      attitude boded ill for the future: "A belief, conviction, or prejudice, or
      whatever you may call it," he said, "so widely spread and apparently
      deeply rooted as this, that the negro will not work without physical
      compulsion, is certainly calculated to have a very serious influence upon
      the conduct of the people entertaining it. It naturally produced a desire
      to preserve slavery in its original form as much and as long as
      possible &hellip; or to introduce into the new system that element of physical
      compulsion which would make the negro work."
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_046" id="Page_046">46</a></span>
			The negro wished to be free to leave his job when he pleased, but,
			as Benjamin C. Truman stated in his report to President Johnson, a
			"result of the settled belief in the negro's inferiority, and in the
			necessity that he should not be left to himself without a guardian,
			is that in some sections he is discouraged from leaving his old master.
			I have known of planters who considered it an offence against
			neighborhood courtesy for another to hire their old hands, and in two
			instances that were reported the disputants came to blows over the
			breach of etiquette." The new Freedmen's Bureau insisted upon written
      contracts, except for day laborers, and this undoubtedly kept many negroes
      from working regularly, for they were suspicious of contracts. Besides,
      the agitators and the negro troops led them to hope for an eventual
      distribution of property. An Alabama planter thus described the situation
      in December, 1865:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      They will not work for anything but wages, and few are able to pay wages.
      They are penniless but resolute in their demands. They expect to see all
      the land divided out equally between them and their old masters in time to
      make the next crop. One of the most intelligent black men I know told me
      that in a neighboring village, where several hundred blacks were
      congregated,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_047" id="Page_047">47</a></span>
			he does not think that as many as three made contracts,
      although planters are urgent in their solicitations and offering highest
      prices for labor they can possibly afford to pay. The same man informed me
      that the impression widely prevails that Congress is about to divide out
      the lands, and that this impression is given out by Federal soldiers at
      the nearest military station. It cannot be disguised that in spite of the
      most earnest efforts of their old master to conciliate and satisfy them,
      the estrangement between races increases in its extent and bitterness.
      Nearly all the negro men are armed with repeaters, and many of them carry
      them openly, day and night.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The relations between the races were better, however, than conditions
      seemed to indicate. The whites of the Black Belt were better disposed
      toward the negroes than were those of the white districts. It was in the
      towns and villages that most of the race conflicts occurred. All whites
      agreed that the negro was inferior, but there were many who were grateful
      for his conduct during the war and who wished him well. But others, the
      policemen of the towns, the "loyalists," those who had little but pride of
      race and the vote to distinguish them from the blacks, felt no good will
      toward the ex-slaves. It was Truman's opinion "not only that the planters
      are far better friends to the negroes than the poor whites, but also
      better
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_048" id="Page_048">48</a></span>
			than a majority of the Northern men who go South to rent
      plantations." John T. Trowbridge, the novelist, who recorded his
      impressions of the South after a visit in 1865, was of the opinion that
      the Unionists "do not like niggers." "For there is," he said, "more
      prejudice against color among the middle and poorer classes&mdash;the
      Union men of the South who owned few or no slaves&mdash;than among the
      planters who owned them by scores and hundreds." The reports of the
      Freedmen's Bureau are to the same effect. A Bureau agent in Tennessee
      testified: "An old citizen, a Union man, said to me, said he, 'I tell you
      what, if you take away the military from Tennessee, the buzzards can't eat
      up the niggers as fast as we'll kill them.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      The lawlessness of the negroes in parts of the Black Belt and the
      disturbing influences of the black troops, of some officials of the
      Bureau, and of some of the missionary teachers and preachers, caused the
      whites to fear insurrections and to take measures for protection. Secret
      semi-military organizations were formed which later developed into the Ku
      Klux orders. When, however, New Year's Day, 1866 passed without the
      hoped-for distribution of property the negroes began to settle down.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the beginning of the period of reconstruction
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_049" id="Page_049">49</a></span>
			it seemed possible that
      the negro race might speedily fall into distinct economic groups, for
      there were some who had property and many others who had the ability and
      the opportunity to acquire it; but the later drawing of race lines and the
      political disturbances of reconstruction checked this tendency. It was
      expected also that the Northern planters who came South in large numbers
      in 1865-66 might, by controlling the negro labor and by the use of more
      efficient methods, aid in the economic upbuilding of the country. But they
      were ignorant of agricultural matters and incapable of wisely controlling
      the blacks; and they failed because at one time they placed too much trust
      in the negroes and at another treated them too harshly and expected too
      much of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The question of negro suffrage was not a live issue in the South until the
      middle of 1866. There was almost no talk about it among the negroes; they
      did not know what it was. President Lincoln in 1864 and President Johnson
      in 1865 had merely mentioned the subject, though Chief Justice Chase and
      prominent radical members of Congress, as well as numerous abolitionists,
      had framed a negro suffrage platform. But the Southern whites, considering
      the matter an impossibility, gave it
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_050" id="Page_050">50</a></span>
			little consideration. There was, however, both North and South, a
			tendency to see a connection between the freedom of the negroes and
			their political rights and thus to confuse civil equality with political
			and social privileges. But the great masses of the whites were solidly
			opposed to the recognition of negro equality in any form. The poorer
			whites, especially the "Unionists" who hoped to develop an opposition
			party, were angered by any discussion of the subject. An Alabama
			"Unionist," M.&nbsp;J. Saffold, later prominent as a radical politician,
			declared to the Joint Committee on Reconstruction: "If you compel us to
			carry through universal suffrage of colored men &hellip; it will prove
			quite an incubus upon us in the organization of a national union party
			of white men; it will furnish our opponents with a very effective weapon
			of offense against us."
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, however, some Southern leaders of ability and standing who, by
      1866, were willing to consider negro suffrage. These men, among them
      General Wade Hampton of South Carolina and Governor Robert Patton of
      Alabama, were of the slaveholding class, and they fully counted on being
      able to control the negro's vote by methods similar to those actually put
      in force a quarter of a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_051" id="Page_051">51</a></span>
			century later. The negroes were not as yet politically organized,
			were not even interested in politics, and the master class might
			reasonably hope to regain control of them. Whitelaw Reid published
			an interview with one of the Hamptons which describes the situation
			exactly:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      A brother of General Wade Hampton, the South Carolina Hotspur, was on
      board. He saw no great objection to negro suffrage, so far as the whites
      were concerned; and for himself, South Carolinian and secessionist though
      he was, he was quite willing to accept it. He only dreaded its effect on
      the blacks themselves. Hitherto they had in the main, been modest and
      respectful, and mere freedom was not likely to spoil them. But the
      deference to them likely to be shown by partisans eager for their votes
      would have a tendency to uplift them and unbalance them. Beyond this, no
      harm would be done the South by negro suffrage. The old owners would cast
      the votes of their people almost as absolutely and securely as they cast
      their own. If Northern men expected in this way to build up a northern
      party in the South, they were gravely mistaken. They would only be
      multiplying the power of the old and natural leaders of Southern politics
      by giving every vote to a former slave. Heretofore such men had served
      their masters only in the fields; now they would do no less faithful
      service at the polls. If the North could stand it, the South could. For
      himself, he should make no special objection to negro suffrage as one of
      the terms of reorganization, and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_052" id="Page_052">52</a></span>
			if it came, he did not think the South
      would have much cause to regret it.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      To sum up the situation at this time: the negro population at the close of
      the war constituted a tremendous problem for those in authority. The race
      was free, but without status, without leaders, without property, and
      without education. Probably a fourth of them had some experience in
      freedom before the Confederate armies surrendered, and the servitude of
      the other three millions ended very quickly and without violence. But in
      the Black Belt, where the bulk of the black population was to be found,
      the labor system was broken up, and for several months the bewildered
      freedmen wandered about or remained at home under conditions which were
      bad for health, morals, and thrift. The Northern negroes did not furnish
      the expected leadership for the race, and the more capable men in the
      South showed a tendency to go North. The unsettled state of the negroes
      and their expectation of receiving a part of the property of the whites
      kept the latter uneasy and furnished the occasion of frequent conflicts.
      Not the least of the unsettling influences at work upon the negro
      population were the colored troops and the agitators furnished by the
      Freedmen's Bureau, the missions,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_053" id="Page_053">53</a></span>
			and the Bureau schools. But at the beginning of the year 1866 the
			situation appeared to be clearing, and the social and economic
			revolution seemed on the way to a quieter ending than might have
			been expected.

      war ended slavery, but it left the problem of the freed slave; it
      preserved the Union in theory, but it left unsolved many delicate problems
      of readjustment. Were the seceded States in or out of the Union? If in the
      Union, what rights had they? If they were not in the Union, what was their
      status? What was the status of the Southern Unionist, of the
      ex-Confederate? What punishments should be inflicted upon the Southern
      people? What authority, executive or legislative, should carry out the
      work of reconstruction? The end of the war brought with it, in spite of
      much discussion, no clear answer to these perplexing questions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unfortunately, American political life, with its controversies over
      colonial government, its conflicting interpretations of written
      constitutions, and its legally trained statesmen, had by the middle of the
      nineteenth century produced a habit
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_055" id="Page_055">55</a></span>
			of political thought which demanded the settlement of most governmental
			matters upon a theoretical basis. And now in 1865 each prominent leader
			had his own plan of reconstruction fundamentally irreconcilable with all
			the others, because rigidly theoretical. During the war the powers of
			the Executive had been greatly expanded and a legislative reaction was
			to be expected. The Constitution called for fresh interpretation in the
			light of the Civil War and its results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first theory of reconstruction may be found in the Crittenden-Johnson
      resolutions of July, 1861, which declared that the war was being waged to
      maintain the Union under the Constitution and that it should cease when
      these objects were obtained. This would have been subscribed to in 1861 by
      the Union Democrats and by most of the Republicans, and in 1865 the
      conquered Southerners would have been glad to re&euml;nter the Union upon
			this basis; but though in 1865 the resolution still expressed the views of
			many Democrats, the majority of Northern people had moved away from this
      position.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attitude of Lincoln, which in 1865 met the views of a majority of the
      Northern people though not of the political leaders, was that "no State
      can
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_056" id="Page_056">56</a></span>
			upon its mere motion get out of the Union," that the States survived
      though there might be some doubt about state governments, and that "loyal"
      state organizations might be established by a population consisting
      largely of ex-Confederates who had been pardoned by the President and made
      "loyal" for the future by an oath of allegiance. Reconstruction was,
      Lincoln thought, a matter for the Executive to handle. But that he was not
      inflexibly committed to any one plan is indicated by his proclamation
      after the pocket veto of the Wade-Davis Bill and by his last speech, in
      which he declared that the question of whether the seceded States were in
      the Union or out of it was "merely a pernicious abstraction." In addition,
      Lincoln said:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      We are all agreed that the seceded States, so called, are out of their
      proper practical relation with the Union, and that the sole object of the
      government, civil and military, in regard to those States is to again get
      them into that proper practical relation. I believe that it is not only
      possible, but in fact easier, to do this without deciding or even
      considering whether these States have ever been out of the Union, than
      with it. Finding themselves safely at home, it would be utterly immaterial
      whether they had ever been abroad. Let us all join in doing the acts
      necessary to restore the proper practical relations between these States
      and the Union, and each
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_057" id="Page_057">57</a></span>
			forever after innocently indulge his own opinion whether in doing the
			acts he brought the States from without into the Union, or only gave
			them proper assistance, they never having been out of it.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      President Johnson's position was essentially that of Lincoln, but his
      attitude toward the working out of the several problems was different. He
      maintained that the States survived and that it was the duty of the
      Executive to restore them to their proper relations. "The true theory,"
      said he, "is that all pretended acts of secession were from the beginning
      null and void. The States cannot commit treason nor screen individual
      citizens who may have committed treason any more than they can make valid
      treaties or engage in lawful commerce with any foreign power. The States
      attempting to secede placed themselves in a condition where their vitality
      was impaired, but not extinguished; their functions suspended, but not
      destroyed." Lincoln would have had no severe punishments inflicted even on
      leaders, but Johnson wanted to destroy the "slavocracy," root and branch.
      Confiscation of estates would, he thought, be a proper measure. He said on
      one occasion: "Traitors should take a back seat in the work of
      restoration.&hellip; My judgment is that he [a rebel]
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_058" id="Page_058">58</a></span>
			should be subjected to a severe ordeal before he is restored to
			citizenship. Treason should be made odious, and traitors must be
			punished and impoverished. Their great plantations must be seized,
			and divided into small farms and sold to honest, industrious men."
			The violence of Johnson's views subsequently underwent considerable
			modification but to the last he held to the plan of executive
			restoration based upon state perdurance. Neither Lincoln nor
      Johnson favored a change of Southern institutions other than the
			abolition of slavery, though each recommended a qualified negro suffrage.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were, however, other theories in the field, notably those of the
      radical Republican leaders. According to the state-suicide theory of
      Charles Sumner, "any vote of secession or other act by which any State may
      undertake to put an end to the supremacy of the Constitution within its
      territory is inoperative and void against the Constitution, and when
      sustained by force it becomes a practical <em>abdication</em> by the State
			of all rights under the Constitution, while the treason it involves still
			further works an instant <em>forfeiture</em> of all those functions and
			powers essential to the continued existence of the State as a body
			politic, so that from
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_059" id="Page_059">59</a></span>
			that time forward the territory falls under the exclusive jurisdiction of
      Congress as other territory, and the State, being according to the
      language of the law <i>felo de se</i>, ceases to exist." Congress should
			punish the "rebels" by abolishing slavery, by giving civil and political
			rights to negroes, and by educating them with the whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not essentially different, but harsher, was Thaddeus Stevens's plans for
      treating the South as a conquered foreign province. Let the victors treat
      the seceded States "as conquered provinces and settle them with new men
      and exterminate or drive out the present rebels as exiles." Congress in
      dealing with these provinces was not bound even by the Constitution, "a
      bit of worthless parchment," but might legislate as it pleased in regard
      to slavery, the ballot, and confiscation. With regard to the white
      population he said: "I have never desired bloody punishments to any great
      extent. But there are punishments quite as appalling, and longer
      remembered, than death. They are more advisable, because they would reach
      a greater number. Strip a proud nobility of their bloated estates; reduce
      them to a level with plain republicans; send them forth to labor, and
      teach their children to enter the workshops or handle a plow,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_060" id="Page_060">60</a></span>
			and you will thus humble the proud traitors." Stevens and Sumner agreed
			in reducing the Southern States to a territorial status. Sumner would
			then take the principles of the Declaration of Independence as a guide
			for Congress, while Stevens would leave Congress absolute. Neither
			considered the Constitution as of any validity in this crisis.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a rule the former abolitionists were in 1865 advocates of votes and
      lands for the negro, in whose capacity for self-rule they had complete
      confidence. The view of Gerrit Smith may be regarded as typical of the
      abolitionist position:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      Let the first condition of peace with them be that no people in the rebel
      States shall ever lose or gain civil or political rights by reason of
      their race or origin. The next condition of peace be that our black allies
      in the South&mdash;those saviours of our nation&mdash;shall share with
      their poor white neighbors in the subdivisions of the large landed estates
      of the South. Let the only other condition be that the rebel masses shall
      not, for say, a dozen years, be allowed access to the ballot-box, or be
      eligible to office; and that the like restrictions be for life on their
      political and military leaders.&hellip; The mass of the Southern blacks
			fall, in point of intelligence, but little, if any, behind the mass of the
      Southern whites.&hellip; In reference to the qualifications of the voter,
			men make too much account of the head and too little of the heart. The
      ballot-box, like God, says: "Give me your heart."
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_061" id="Page_061">61</a></span>
			The best-hearted men are the best qualified to vote; and, in this light,
			the blacks, with their characteristic gentleness, patience, and
			affectionateness, are peculiarly entitled to vote. We cannot wonder at
			Swedenborg's belief that the celestial people will be found in the
			interior of Africa; nor hardly can we wonder at the legend that the
			gods came down every year to sup with their favorite Africans.
    </p>

      One of the most statesmanlike proposals was made by Governor John A.
      Andrew of Massachusetts. If, forgetting their theories, the conservatives
      could have united in support of a restoration conceived in his spirit, the
      goal might have been speedily achieved. Andrew demanded a reorganization,
      based upon acceptance of the results of the war, but carried through with
      the aid of "those who are by their intelligence and character the natural
      leaders of their people and who surely will lead them by and by." These

      The Southerners, Unionists as well as Confederates, had their views as
      well, but at Washington these carried little influence. The former
      Confederates would naturally favor the plan which promised best for the
      white South, and their views were most nearly met by those of President
      Lincoln. Although he held that in principle a new Union had arisen out of
      the war, as a matter of immediate political expediency he was prepared to
      build on the assumption that the old Union still existed. The Southern
      Unionists cared little for theories; they wanted the Confederates
      punished, themselves
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_063" id="Page_063">63</a></span>
			promoted to high offices, and the negro kept from the
      ballot box.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even at the beginning of 1866, it was not too much to hope that the
      majority of former Republicans would accept conservative methods, provided
      the so-called "fruits of the war" were assured&mdash;that is, equality of
      civil rights, the guarantee of the United States war debt, the repudiation
      of the Confederate debt, the temporary disfranchisement of the leading
      Confederates, and some arrangement which would keep the South from
      profiting by representation based on the non-voting negro population. But
      amid many conflicting policies, none attained to continuous and compelling
      authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan first put to trial was that of President Lincoln. It was a
      definite plan designed to meet actual conditions and, had he lived, he
      might have been able to carry it through successfully. Not a theorist, but
      an opportunist of the highest type, sobered by years of responsibility in
      war time, and fully understanding the precarious situation in 1865,
      Lincoln was most anxious to secure an early restoration of solidarity with
      as little friction as possible. Better than most Union leaders he
      appreciated conditions in the South, the problem of the races, the
      weakness of the Southern Unionists,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_064" id="Page_064">64</a></span>
			and the advantage of calling in the old Southern leaders. He was generous
			and considerate; he wanted no executions or imprisonments; he wished the
			leaders to escape; and he was anxious that the mass of Southerners be
			welcomed back without loss of rights. "There is," he declared, "too
			little respect for their rights," an unwillingness, in short, to treat
			them as fellow citizens.
    </p>
    <p>
      This executive policy had been applied from the beginning of the war as
      opportunity offered. The President used the army to hold the Border States
      in the Union, to aid in "reorganizing" Unionist Virginia and in
      establishing West Virginia. The army, used to preserve the Union might be
      used also to restore disturbed parts of it to normal condition. Assuming
      that the "States" still existed, "loyal" state governments were the first
      necessity. By his proclamation of December 8, 1863, Lincoln suggested a
      method of beginning the reconstruction: he would pardon any Confederate,
      except specified classes of leaders, who took an oath of loyalty for the
      future; if as many as ten per cent of the voting population of 1860, thus
      made loyal, should establish a state government the Executive would
      recognize it. The matter of slavery must, indeed, be left to the laws and
      proclamations
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_065" id="Page_065">65</a></span>
			as interpreted by the courts, but other institutions should
      continue as in 1861.
    </p>
    <p>
      This plan was inaugurated in four States which had been in part controlled
      by the Federal army from nearly the beginning of the war: Tennessee
      (1862), Louisiana (1862), Arkansas (1862), and Virginia after the
      formation of West Virginia (1863). For each State, Lincoln appointed a
      military governor: for Tennessee, Andrew Johnson; for Arkansas, John S.
      Phelps; for Louisiana, General Shepley. In Virginia he recognized the
      "reorganized" government, which had been transferred to Alexandria when
      the new State of West Virginia was formed. The military governors
      undertook the slow and difficult work of reorganization, however, with but
      slight success owing to the small numbers of Unionists and of Confederates
      who would take the oath. But by 1864 "ten per cent" state governments were
      established in Arkansas and Louisiana, and progress was being made in
      Tennessee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Congress was impatient of Lincoln's claim to executive precedence in the
      matter of reconstruction, and in 1864 both Houses passed the Wade-Davis
      Bill, a plan which asserted the right of Congress to control
      reconstruction and foreshadowed a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_066" id="Page_066">66</a></span>
			radical settlement of the question. Lincoln disposed of the bill by a
			pocket veto and, in a proclamation dated July 8, 1864, stated that he
			was unprepared "to be inflexibly committed to any single plan of
			restoration," or to discourage loyal citizens by setting aside the
			governments already established in Louisiana and Arkansas, or to
			recognize the authority of Congress to abolish slavery. He was ready,
			however, to co&ouml;perate with the people of any State who wished to
			accept the plan prepared by Congress and he hoped that a constitutional
      amendment abolishing slavery would be adopted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lincoln early came to the conclusion that slavery must be destroyed, and
      he had urgently advocated deportation of the freedmen, for he believed
      that the two races could not live in harmony after emancipation. The
      nearest he came to recommending the vote for the negro was in a
      communication to Governor Hahn of Louisiana in March, 1864: "I barely
      suggest, for your private consideration, whether some of the colored
      people may not be let in, as for instance, the very intelligent, and
      especially those who have fought gallantly in our ranks. They would
      probably help, in some trying time to come, to keep the jewel of liberty
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_067" id="Page_067">67</a></span>
      within the family of freedom. But this is only a suggestion, not to the
      public, but to you alone."
    </p>
    <p>
      Throughout the war President Lincoln assumed that the state organizations
      in the South were illegal because disloyal and that new governments must
      be established. But just at the close of the war, probably carried away by
      feeling, he all but recognized the Virginia Confederate Government as
      competent to bring the State back into the Union. While in Richmond on
      April 5, 1865, he gave to Judge Campbell a statement of terms: the
      national authority to be restored; no recession on slavery by the
      Executive; hostile forces to disband. The next day he notified General
      Weitzel, in command at Richmond, that he might permit the Virginia
      Legislature to meet and withdraw military and other support from the
      Confederacy. But these measures met strong opposition in Washington,
      especially from Secretary Stanton and Senator Wade and other congressional
      leaders, and on the 11th of April Lincoln withdrew his permission for the
      Legislature to meet. "I cannot go forward," he said, "with everybody
      opposed to me." It was on the same day that he made his last public
      speech, and Sumner, who was strongly opposed to his policy, remarked that
      "the President's
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_068" id="Page_068">68</a></span>
			speech and other things augur confusion and uncertainty
      in the future, with hot contumacy." At a cabinet meeting on the 14th of
      April, Lincoln made his last statement on the subject. It was fortunate,
      he said, that Congress had adjourned, for "we shall reanimate the States"
      before Congress meets; there should be no killing, no persecutions; there
      was too much disposition to treat the Southern people "not as fellow
      citizens."
    </p>
    <p>
      The possibility of a conciliatory restoration ended when Lincoln was
      assassinated. Moderate, firm, tactful, of great personal influence, not a
      doctrinaire, and not a Southerner like Johnson, Lincoln might have
      "prosecuted peace" successfully. His policy was very unlike that proposed
      by the radical leaders. They would base the new governments upon the
      loyalty of the past plus the aid of enfranchised slaves; he would
      establish the new r&eacute;gime upon the loyalty of the future. Like
			Governor Andrew he thought that restoration must be effected by the
			willing efforts of the South. He would aid and guide but not force the
			people. If the latter did not wish restoration, they might remain under
			military rule. There should be no forced negro suffrage, no sweeping
			disfranchisement of whites, no "carpetbaggism."
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_069" id="Page_069">69</a></span>
      The work of President Johnson demands for its proper understanding some
      consideration of the condition of the political parties at the close of
      the war, for politics had much to do with reconstruction. The Democratic
      party, divided and defeated in the election of 1860, lost its Southern
      members in 1861 by the secession and remained a minority party during the
      remainder of the war. It retained its organization, however, and in 1864
      polled a large vote. Discredited by its policy of opposition to Lincoln's
      Administration, its ablest leaders joined the Republicans in support of
      the war. Until 1869 the party was poorly represented in Congress
      although, as soon as hostilities ended, the War Democrats showed a
      tendency to return to the old party. As to reconstruction, the party stood
      on the Crittenden-Johnson resolutions of 1861, though most Democrats were
      now willing to have slavery abolished.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republican party&mdash;frankly sectional and going into power on the
      single issue of opposition to the extension of slavery&mdash;was forced by
      the secession movement to take up the task of preserving the Union by war.
      Consequently, the party developed new principles, welcomed the aid of the
      War Democrats, and found it advisable to
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_070" id="Page_070">70</a></span>
			drop its name and with its allies to form the Union or National Union
			party. It was this National Union party which in 1864 nominated Abraham
			Lincoln, a Republican, and Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, on the same ticket.
			Lincoln's second Cabinet was composed of both Republicans and War
			Democrats. When the war ended, the conservative leaders were anxious to
			hold the Union party together in order to be in a better position to
			settle the problems of reconstruction, but the movement of the War
			Democrats back to their old party tended to leave in the Union party only
			its Republican members, with the radical leaders dominating.

      In the South the pressure of war so united the people that party divisions
      disappeared for a time, but the causes of division continued to exist and
      two parties, at least, would have developed had the pressure been removed.
      Though all factions supported the war after it began, the former Whigs and
      Douglas Democrats, when it was over, liked to remember that they had been
      "Union" men in 1860 and expected to organize in opposition to the extreme
      Democrats, who were now charged with being responsible for the misfortunes
      of the South. They were in a position to affiliate with the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_071" id="Page_071">71</a></span>
			National Union
      party of the North if proper inducements were offered, while the regular
      Democrats were ready to rejoin their old party. But the embittered
      feelings resulting from the murder of Lincoln and the rapid development of
      the struggle between President Johnson and Congress caused the radicals
      "to lump the old Union Democrats and Whigs together with the secessionists&mdash;and
      many were driven where they did not want to go, into temporary affiliation
      with the Democratic party." Thousands went very reluctantly; the old
      Whigs, indeed, were not firmly committed to the Democrats until radical
      reconstruction had actually begun. Still other "loyalists" in the South
      were prepared to join the Northern radicals in advocating the
      disfranchisement of Confederates and in opposing the granting of suffrage
      to the negroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man upon whom fell the task of leading these opposing factions,
      radical and conservative, along a definite line of action looking to
      reunion had few qualifications for the task. Johnson was ill-educated,
      narrow, and vindictive and was positive that those who did not agree with
      him were dishonest. Himself a Southerner, picked up by the National Union
      Convention of 1864, as Thaddeus Stevens said, from "one of those damned
      rebel
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_072" id="Page_072">72</a></span>
			provinces," he loved the Union, worshiped the Constitution, and held
      to the strict construction views of the State Rights Democrats. Rising
      from humble beginnings, he was animated by the most intense dislike of the
      "slavocracy," as he called the political aristocracy of the South. Like
      many other American leaders he was proud of his humble origin, but unlike
      many others he never sloughed off his backwoods crudeness. He continually
      boasted of himself and vilified the aristocrats, who in return treated him
      badly. His dislike of them was so marked that Isham G. Harris, a rival
      politician, remarked that "if Johnson were a snake, he would lie in the
      grass to bite the heels of rich men's children." His primitive notions of
      punishment were evident in 1865 when he advocated imprisonment, execution,
      and confiscation; but like other reckless talkers he often said more than
      he meant.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Johnson succeeded to the presidency, the feeling was nearly universal
      among the radicals, according to Julian, that he would prove a godsend to
      the country, for "aside from Mr. Lincoln's known policy of tenderness to
      the rebels, which now so jarred upon the feelings of the hour, his well
      known views on the subject of reconstruction were as distasteful as
      possible to radical Republicans."
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_073" id="Page_073">73</a></span>
			Senator Wade declared to the President:
      "Johnson, we have faith in you. By the gods, there will be no trouble now
      in running the Government!" To which Johnson replied: "Treason is a crime
      and crime must be punished. Treason must be made infamous and traitors
      must be impoverished." These words are an index to the speeches of Johnson
      during 1863-65. Even his radical friends feared that he would be too
      vindictive. For a few weeks he was much inclined to the radical plans, and
      some of the leaders certainly understood that he was in favor of negro
      suffrage, the supreme test of radicalism. But when the excitement caused
      by the assassination of Lincoln and the break-up of the Confederacy had
      moderated somewhat, Johnson saw before him a task so great that his desire
      for violent measures was chilled. He must disband the great armies and
      bring all war work to an end; he must restore intercourse with the South,
      which had been blockaded for years; he must for a time police the country,
      look after the negroes, and set up a temporary civil government; and
      finally he must work out a restoration of the Union. Sobered by
      responsibility and by the influence of moderate advisers, he rather
      quickly adopted Lincoln's policy.
	</p>
	<p>
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_074" id="Page_074">74</a></span>
			Johnson at first set his face against the movements toward reconstruction
			by the state governments already organized and by those people who wished
			to organize new governments on Lincoln's ten per cent plan. As soon as
			possible the War Department notified the Union commanders to stop all
			attempts at reconstruction and to pursue and arrest all Confederate
			governors and other prominent civil leaders. The President was even
			anxious to arrest the military leaders who had been paroled but was
			checked in this desire by General Grant's firm protest. His cabinet
			advisers supported Johnson in refusing to recognize the Southern state
			governments; but three of them&mdash;Seward, Welles, and
			McCulloch&mdash;were influential in moderating his zeal for inflicting
      punishments. Nevertheless he soon had in prison the most prominent of the
      Confederate civilians and several general officers. The soldiers, however,
      were sent home, trade with the South was permitted, and the Freedmen's
      Bureau was rapidly extended.
    </p>
    <p>
      Previous to this Johnson had brought himself to recognize, early in May,
      the Lincoln "ten per cent" governments of Louisiana, Tennessee, and
      Arkansas, and the reconstructed Alexandria government of Virginia. Thus
      only seven States were
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_075" id="Page_075">75</a></span>
			left without legal governments, and to bring those States back into the
			Union, Johnson inaugurated on May 29, 1865, a plan which was like that
			of Lincoln but not quite so liberal. In his Amnesty Proclamation, Johnson
			made a longer list of exceptions aimed especially at the once wealthy
			slave owners. On the same day he proclaimed the restoration of North
			Carolina. A provisional governor, W.&nbsp;W. Holden, was appointed and
			directed to reorganize the civil government and to call a constitutional
			convention elected by those who had taken the amnesty oath. This
			convention was to make necessary amendments to the constitution and
      to "restore said State to its constitutional relations to the Federal
      Government." It is to be noted that Johnson fixed the qualifications of
      delegates and of those who elected them, but, this stage once passed, the
      convention or the legislature would "prescribe the qualifications of
      electors &hellip; a power the people of the several States composing the
			Federal Union have rightfully exercised from the origin of the government
			to the present time." The President also directed the various cabinet
			officers to extend the work of their departments over the Confederate
			States and ordered the army officers to assist the civil
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_076" id="Page_076">76</a></span>
			authorities. During the next six weeks similar measures were undertaken
			for the remaining six States of the Confederacy.
    </p>
    <p>
      To set up the new order army officers were first sent into every county
      to administer the amnesty oath and thus to secure a "loyal" electorate. In
      each State the provisional governor organized out of the remains of the
      Confederate local r&eacute;gime a new civil government. Confederate local
      officials who could and would take the amnesty oath were directed to
      resume office until relieved; the laws of 1861, except those relating to
      slavery, were declared to be in force; the courts were directed to use
      special efforts to crush lawlessness; and the old jury lists were
      destroyed and new ones were drawn up containing only the names of those
      who had taken the amnesty oath. Since there was no money in any state
      treasury, small sums were now raised by license taxes. A full staff of
      department heads was appointed, and by July, 1865, the provisional
      governments were in fair working order.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the constitutional conventions, which met in the fall, it was made
      clear, through the governors, that the President would insist upon three
      conditions: the formal abolition of slavery, the repudiation of the
      ordinance of secession, and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_077" id="Page_077">77</a></span>
			the repudiation of the Confederate war debt.
      To Governor Holden he telegraphed: "Every dollar of the debt created to
      aid the rebellion against the United States should be repudiated finally
      and forever. The great mass of the people should not be taxed to pay a
      debt to aid in carrying on a rebellion which they in fact, if left to
      themselves, were opposed to. Let those who had given their means for the
      obligations of the state look to that power they tried to establish in
      violation of law, constitution, and will of the people. They must meet
      their fate." With little opposition these conditions were fulfilled,
      though there was a strong feeling against the repudiation of the debt,
      much discussion as to whether the ordinance of secession should be
      "repealed" or declared "now and always null and void," and some quibbling
      as to whether slavery was being destroyed by state action or had already
      been destroyed by war.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the old state constitutions, very slight changes were made. Of these
      the chief were concerned with the abolition of slavery and the arrangement
      of representation and direct taxation on the basis of white population.
      Little effort was made to settle any of the negro problems, and in all
      States the conventions left it to the legislatures to make
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_078" id="Page_078">78</a></span>
			laws for the freedmen. There was no discussion of negro suffrage in the
			conventions, but President Johnson sent what was for him a remarkable
			communication to Governor Sharkey of Mississippi:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      If you could extend the elective franchise to all persons of color who
      can read the Constitution of the United States in English and write their
      names, and to all persons of color who own real estate valued at not less
      than two hundred and fifty dollars and pay taxes thereon, you would
      completely disarm the adversary and set an example the other States will
      follow. This you can do with perfect safety, and you would thus place
      Southern States in reference to free persons of color upon the same basis
      with the free States.&hellip; And as a consequence the radicals, who are
			wild upon negro franchise, will be completely foiled in their attempts to
			keep the Southern States from renewing their relations to the Union by not
      accepting their senators and representatives.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      In deciding upon a basis of representation it was clear that the majority
      of delegates desired to lessen the influence of the Black Belt and place
      the control of the government with the "up country." In the Alabama
      convention Robert M. Patton, then a delegate and later governor, frankly
      avowed this object, and in South Carolina Governor Perry urged the
      convention to give no consideration to negro suffrage, "because this is a
      white man's
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_079" id="Page_079">79</a></span>
			government," and if the negroes should vote they would be
      controlled by a few whites. A kindly disposition toward the negroes was
      general except on the part of extreme Unionists, who opposed any favors to
      the race. "This is a white man's country" was a doctrine to which all the
      conventions subscribed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conventions held brief sessions, completed their work, and adjourned,
      after directing that elections be held for state and local officers and
      for members of Congress. Before December the appointed local officials had
      been succeeded by elected officers; members of Congress were on their way
      to Washington; the state legislatures were assembling or already in
      session; and the elected governors were ready to take office. It was
      understood that as soon as enough state legislatures ratified the
      Thirteenth Amendment to make it a part of the Constitution, the President
      would permit the transfer of authority to the new governors. The
      Legislature of Mississippi alone was recalcitrant about the amendment, and
      before January, 1866, the elected officials were everywhere installed
      except in Texas, where the work was not completed until March. When
      Congress met in December, 1865, the President reported that all former
      Confederate States except Texas were
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_080" id="Page_080">80</a></span>
			ready to be readmitted. Congress, however, refused to admit their
			senators and representatives, and thus began the struggle which ended
			over a year later with the victory of the radicals and the undoing of
			the work of the two Presidents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The plan of the Presidents was at best only imperfectly realized. It was
      found impossible to reorganize the Federal Administration in the South
      with men who could subscribe to the "ironclad oath," for nearly all who
      were competent to hold office had favored or aided the Confederacy. It was
      two years before more than a third of the post offices could be opened.
      The other Federal departments were in similar difficulties, and at last
      women and "carpetbaggers" were appointed. The Freedmen's Bureau, which had
      been established coincidently with the provisional governments, assumed
      jurisdiction over the negroes, while the army authorities very early took
      the position that any man who claimed to be a Unionist should not be tried
      in the local courts but must be given a better chance in a provost court.
      Thus a third or more of the population was withdrawn from the control of
      the state government. In several States the head of the Bureau made
      arrangements for local magistrates and officials to act as
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_081" id="Page_081">81</a></span>
			Bureau officials, and in such cases the two authorities acted in
			co&ouml;peration. The army of occupation, too, exerted an authority which
			not infrequently interfered with the workings of the new state government.
			Nearly everywhere there was a lack of certainty and efficiency due to the
      concurrent and sometimes conflicting jurisdictions of state government,
      army commanders, Bureau authorities, and even the President acting upon or
      through any of the others.
    </p>
    <p>
      The standing of the Southern state organizations was in doubt after the
      refusal of Congress to recognize them. Nevertheless, in spite of this
      uncertainty they continued to function as States during the year of
      controversy which followed; the courts were opened and steadily grew in
      influence; here and there militia and patrols were reorganized; officials
      who refused to "accept the situation" were dismissed; elections were held;
      the legislatures revised the laws to fit new conditions and enacted new
      laws for the emancipated blacks. To all this progress in reorganization
      the action of Congress was a severe blow, since it gave notice that none
      of the problems of reconstruction were yet solved. An increasing spirit of
      irritation and independence was observed throughout the States in
      question,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_082" id="Page_082">82</a></span>
			and at the elections the former Confederates gained more and
      more offices. The year was marked in the South by the tendency toward the
      formation of parties, by the development of the "Southern outrages" issue,
      by an attempt to frustrate radical action, and finally by a line-up of the
      great mass of the whites in opposition to the Fourteenth Amendment and
      other radical plans of Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Joint Committee on Reconstruction, appointed when Congress refused to
      accept the work of President Johnson, proceeded during several months to
      take testimony and to consider measures. The testimony, which was taken
      chiefly to support opinions already formed, appeared to prove that the
      negroes and the Unionists were so badly treated that the Freedmen's Bureau
      and the army must be kept in the South to protect them; that free negro
      labor was a success but that the whites were hostile to it; that the
      whites were disloyal and would, if given control of the Southern
      governments and admitted to Congress, constitute a danger to the nation
      and especially to the party in power.
    </p>
    <p>
      To convince the voters of the North of the necessity of dealing
      drastically with the South a campaign of misrepresentation was begun in
      the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_083" id="Page_083">83</a></span>
			summer of 1865, which became more and more systematic and unscrupulous
      as the political struggle at Washington grew fiercer. Newspapers regularly
      ran columns headed "Southern Outrages" and every conceivable mistreatment
      of blacks by whites was represented as taking place on a large scale. As
      General Richard Taylor said, it would seem that about 1866 every white
      man, woman, and child in the South began killing and maltreating negroes.
      In truth, there was less and less ground for objection to the treatment of
      the blacks as time went on and as the several agencies of government
      secured firmer control over the lawless elements. But fortunately for the
      radicals their contention seemed to be established by riots on a large
      scale in Memphis and New Orleans where negroes were killed and injured in
      much greater number than whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rapid development of the radical plans of Congress checked the
      tendency toward political division in the South. Only a small party of
      rabid Unionists would now affiliate with the radicals, while all the
      others reluctantly held together, endorsed Johnson's policy, and attempted
      to affiliate with the disintegrating National Union party. But the defeat
      of the President's policies in the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_084" id="Page_084">84</a></span>
			elections of 1866, the increasing radicalism of Congress as shown by the
			Civil Rights Act, the expansion of the Freedmen's Bureau, the report of
			the Joint Committee on Reconstruction, and the proposal of the Fourteenth
			Amendment led farsighted Southerners to see that the President was likely
			to lose in his fight with Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now began, in the latter half of 1866, with some co&ouml;peration in the
			North and probably with the approval of the President, a movement in the
			South to forestall the radicals by means of a settlement which, although
			less severe than the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, might yet be
			acceptable to Congress. One feature of the settlement was to be some form
			of negro suffrage, either by local action or by constitutional amendment.
			Those behind this scheme were mainly of the former governing class. Negro
      suffrage, they thought, would take the wind out of the radical sails, the
      Southern whites would soon be able to control the blacks, representation
      in Congress would be increased, and the Black Belt would perhaps regain
      its former political hegemony. It is hardly necessary to say that the
      majority of the whites were solidly opposed to such a measure. But it was
      hoped to carry it under pressure through the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_085" id="Page_085">85</a></span>
			Legislature or to bring it about indirectly through rulings of the
			Freedmen's Bureau.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coincident with this scheme of partial negro suffrage an attempt was made
      by the conservative leaders in Washington, working with the Southerners,
      to propose a revised Fourteenth Amendment which would give the vote to
      competent negroes and not disfranchise the whites. A conference of
      Southern governors met in Washington early in 1867 and drafted such an
      amendment. But it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Fourteenth Amendment submitted by Congress had been brought
      before the Southern legislatures and during the winter of 1866-67 it was
      rejected by all of them. There was strong opposition to it because it
      disfranchised the leading whites, but perhaps the principal reason for its
      rejection was that the Southern people were not sure that still more
      severe conditions might not be imposed later.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the President was "restoring" the States which had seceded and
      struggling with Congress, the Border States of the South, including
      Tennessee (which was admitted in 1866 by reason of its radical state
      government), were also in the throes of reconstruction. Though there was
      less military
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_086" id="Page_086">86</a></span>
			interference in these than in the other States, many of the
      problems were similar. All had the Freedmen's Bureau, the negro race, the
      Unionists, and the Confederates; in every State, except Kentucky,
      Confederates were persecuted, the minority was in control, and "ring" rule
      was the order of the day; but in each State there were signs of the
      political revolution which a few years later was to put the radicals out
      of power.
    </p>
    <p>
      The executive plan for the restoration of the Union, begun by Lincoln and
      adopted by Johnson, was, as we have seen, at first applied in all the
      States which had seceded. A military governor was appointed in each State
      by the President by virtue of his authority as commander in chief. This
      official, aided by a civilian staff of his own choice and supported by the
      United States army and other Federal agencies, reorganized the state
      administration and after a few months turned the state and local
      governments over to regularly elected officials. Restoration should now
      have been completed, but Congress refused to admit the senators and
      representatives of these States, and entered upon a fifteen months'
      struggle with the President over details of the methods of the
      reconstruction. Meanwhile the Southern States, though unrepresented in
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_087" id="Page_087">87</a></span>
      Congress, continued their activities, with some interference from Federal
      authorities, until Congress in 1867 declared their governments
      non-existent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work begun by Lincoln and Johnson deserved better success. The
      original plan restored to political rights only a small number of
      Unionists, the lukewarm Confederates, and the unimportant. But in spite of
      the threatening speeches of Johnson he used his power of pardon until
      none except the most prominent leaders were excluded. The personnel of the
      Johnson governments was fair. The officials were, in the main, former
      Douglas Democrats and Whigs, respectable and conservative, but not admired
      or loved by the people. The conventions and the legislatures were orderly
      and dignified and manifested a desire to accept the situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were no political parties at first, but material for several
      existed. If things had been allowed to take their course there would have
      arisen a normal cleavage between former Whigs and Democrats, between the
      up-country and the low country, between the slaveholders and the
      nonslaveholders. The average white man in these governments was willing to
      be fair to the negro but was not greatly concerned about his future. In
      the view of most white people it was the white
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_088" id="Page_088">88</a></span>
			man who was emancipated. The white districts had no desire to let the
			power return to the Black Belt by giving the negro the ballot, for the
			vote of the negroes, they believed, would be controlled by their former
			masters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Johnson's adoption of Lincoln's plan gave notice to all that the radicals
      had failed to control him. He and they had little in common; they wished
      to uproot a civilization, while he wished to punish individuals; they were
      not troubled by constitutional scruples, while he was the strictest of
      State Rights Democrats; they thought principally of the negro and his
      potentialities, while Johnson was thinking of the emancipated white man.
      It is possible that Lincoln might have succeeded, but for Johnson the task
      proved too great.

      negroes at the close of the war were not slaves or serfs, nor were
      they citizens. What was to be done with them and for them? The Southern
      answer to this question may be found in the so-called "Black Laws," which
      were enacted by the state governments set up by President Johnson. The
      views of the dominant North may be discerned in part in the organization
      and administration of the Freedmen's Bureau. The two sections saw the same
      problem from different angles and their proposed solutions were of
      necessity opposed in principle and in practice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The South desired to fit the emancipated negro race into the new social
      order by frankly recognizing his inferiority to the whites. In some things
      racial separation was unavoidable. New legislation consequently must be
      enacted, because the slave codes were obsolete; because the old laws
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_090" id="Page_090">90</a></span>
			made for the small free negro class did not meet present conditions; and
      because the emancipated blacks could not be brought conveniently and at
      once under laws originally devised for a white population. The new laws
      must meet many needs; family life, morals, and conduct must be regulated;
      the former slave must be given a status in court in order that he might be
      protected in person and property; the old, the infirm, and the orphans
      must be cared for; the white race must be protected from lawless blacks
      and the blacks from unscrupulous and violent whites; the negro must have
      an opportunity for education; and the roving blacks must be forced to get
      homes, settle down, and go to work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pending such legislation the affairs of the negro remained in control of
      the unpopular Freedmen's Bureau&mdash;a "system of espionage," as Judge
      Clayton of Alabama called it, and, according to Governor Humphreys of
      Mississippi, "a hideous curse" under which white men were persecuted and
      pillaged. Judge Memminger of South Carolina, in a letter to President
      Johnson, emphasized the fact that the whites of England and the United
      States gained civil and political rights through centuries of slow
      advancement and that they were far ahead
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_091" id="Page_091">91</a></span>
			of the people of European states. Consequently, it would be a mistake to
			give the freedmen a status equal to that of the most advanced whites.
			Rather, let the United States profit by the experience of the British in
			their emancipation policies and arrange a system of apprenticeship for a
			period of transition. When the negro should be fit, let him be advanced
			to citizenship.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Southern leaders agreed that the removal of the master's protection
      was a real loss to the negro which must be made good to some extent by
      giving the negro a status in court and by accepting negro testimony in all
      cases in which blacks were concerned. The North Carolina committee on laws
      for freedmen agreed with objectors that "there are comparatively few of
      the slaves lately freed who are honest" and truthful, but maintained that
      the negroes were capable of improvement. The chief executives of
      Mississippi and Florida declared that there was no danger to the whites in
      admitting the more or less unreliable negro testimony, for the courts and
      juries would in every case arrive at a proper valuation of it. Governors
      Marvin of Florida and Humphreys of Mississippi advocated practical civil
      equality, while in North Carolina and several other States there was a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_092" id="Page_092">92</a></span>
      disposition to admit negro testimony only in cases in which negroes were
      concerned. The North Carolina committee recommended the abolition of
      whipping as a punishment unfit for free people, and most States accepted
      this principle. Even in 1865 the general disposition was to make uniform
      laws for both races, except in regard to violation of contracts, immoral
      conduct, vagrancy, marriage, schools, and forms of punishment. In some of
      these matters the whites were to be more strictly regulated; in others,
      the negroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was further general agreement that in economic relations both races
      must be protected, each from the other; but it is plain that the leaders
      believed that the negro had less at stake than the white. The negro was
      disposed to be indolent; he knew little of the obligations of contracts;
      he was not honest; and he would leave his job at will. Consequently
      Memminger recommended apprenticeship for all negroes; Governor Marvin
      suggested it for children alone; and others wished it provided for orphans
      only. Further, the laws enacted must force the negroes to settle down, to
      work, and to hold to contracts. Memminger showed that, without legislation
      to enforce contracts and to secure eviction of those who refused
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_093" id="Page_093">93</a></span>
			to work, the white planter in the South was wholly at the mercy of the
			negro. The plantations were scattered, the laborers' houses were already
			occupied, and there was no labor market to which a planter could go if
			the laborers deserted his fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      What would the negro become if these leaders of reconstruction were to
      have their way? Something better than a serf, something less than a
      citizen&mdash;a second degree citizen, perhaps, with legal rights about
      equal to those of white women and children. Governor Marvin hoped to make
      of the race a good agricultural peasantry; his successor was anxious that
      the blacks should be preferred to European immigrants; others agreed with
      Memminger that after training and education he might be advanced to full
      citizenship.
    </p>
    <p>
      These opinions are representative of those held by the men who, Memminger
      excepted, were placed in charge of affairs by President Johnson and who
      were not specially in sympathy with the negroes or with the planters but
      rather with the average white. All believed that emancipation was a
      mistake, but all agreed that "it is not the negro's fault" and gave no
      evidence of a disposition to perpetuate slavery under another name.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legislation finally framed showed in its
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_094" id="Page_094">94</a></span>
			discriminatory features the combined influence of the old laws for free
			negroes, the vagrancy laws of North and South for whites, the customs of
			slavery times, the British West Indies legislation for ex-slaves, and the
			regulations of the United States War and Treasury Departments and of the
			Freedmen's Bureau&mdash;all modified and elaborated by the Southern
			whites. In only two States, Mississippi and South Carolina, did the
			legislation bulk large in quantity; in other States discriminating laws
			were few; in still other States none were passed except those defining
			race and prohibiting intermarriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      In all of the state laws there were certain common characteristics, among
      which were the following: the descendant of a negro was to be classed as a
      negro through the third generation, &sup1; even though one parent in each
      generation was white; intermarriage of the races was prohibited; existing
      slave marriages were declared valid and for the future marriage was
      generally made easier for the blacks than for the whites. In all States
      the negro was given his day in court, and in cases relating to negroes his
      testimony was accepted; in six States he might testify in any case. When
      provision was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_095" id="Page_095">95</a></span>
			made for schooling, the rule of race separation was enforced. In
			Mississippi the "Jim Crow car," or separate car for negroes, was invented.
			In several States the negro had to have a license to carry weapons, to
			preach, or to engage in trade. In Mississippi, a negro could own land
			only in town; in other States he could purchase land only in the
      country. Why the difference, no one knows and probably few knew at the
      time. Some of the legislation was undoubtedly hasty and ill-considered.
    </p>

&sup1; Fourth in Tennessee.</p>
</div>

    <p>
      But the laws relating to apprenticeship, vagrancy, and enforced punitive
      employment turned out to be of greater practical importance. On these
      subjects the legislation of Mississippi and South Carolina was the most
      extreme. In Mississippi negro orphans were to be bound out, preferably to
			a former master, if "he or she shall be a suitable person." The master was
      given the usual control over apprentices and was bound by the usual
      duties, including that of teaching the apprentice. But the penalties for
      "enticing away" apprentices were severe. The South Carolina statute was
      not essentially different. The vagrancy laws of these two States were in
      the main the same for both races, but in Mississippi the definition of
      vagrancy was enlarged to include negroes not at work,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_096" id="Page_096">96</a></span>
			those "found unlawfully assembling themselves together," and "all white
			persons assembling themselves with freedmen." It is to be noted that
			nearly all punishment for petty offenses took the form of hiring out,
			preferably to the former master or employer. The principal petty offenses
			were, it would seem, vagrancy and "enticing away" laborers or apprentices.
			The South Carolina statute contains some other interesting provisions. A
			negro, man or woman, who had enjoyed the companionship of two or more
			spouses, must by April 1, 1866, select one of them as a permanent partner;
			a farm laborer must "rise at dawn," feed the animals, care for the
			property, be quiet and orderly, and "retire at reasonable hours"; on
			Sunday the servants must take turns in doing the necessary work, and they
			must be respectful and civil to the "master and his family, guests, and
		  agents"; to engage in skilled labor the negro must obtain a license.
			Whipping and the pillory were permitted in Florida for certain offenses,
			and in South Carolina the master might "moderately correct" servants under
			eighteen years of age. Other punishments were generally the same for both
			races, except the hiring out for petty offenses.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Southern point of view none of this
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_097" id="Page_097">97</a></span>
			legislation was regarded as a restriction of negro rights but as a wide
			extension to the negro of rights never before possessed, an adaptation of
			the white man's laws to his peculiar case. It is doubtful whether in some
			of the States the authorities believed that there were any discriminatory
			laws; they probably overlooked some of the free negro legislation already
			on the statute books. In Alabama, for example, General Wager Swayne, the
			head of the Freedmen's Bureau, reported that all such laws had either been
			dropped by the legislature or had been vetoed by the governor. Yet the
			statute books do show some discriminations. There is a marked difference
			between earlier and later legislation. The more stringent laws were
			enacted before the end of 1865. After New Year's Day had passed and the
			negroes had begun to settle down, the legislatures either passed mild laws
			or abandoned all special legislation for the negroes. Later in 1866,
			several States repealed the legislation of 1865.
    </p>
    <p>
      In so far as the "Black Laws" discriminated against the negro they were
      never enforced but were suspended from the beginning by the army and the
      Freedmen's Bureau. They had, however, a very important effect upon that
      section of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_098" id="Page_098">98</a></span>
			Northern opinion which was already suspicious of the good faith
      of the Southerners. They were part of a plan, some believed, to
			re&euml;nslave the negro or at least to create by law a class of serfs.
			This belief did much to bring about later radical legislation.
    </p>
    <p>
      If the "Black Laws" represented the reaction of the Southern legislatures
      to racial conditions, the Freedmen's Bureau was the corresponding result
      of the interest taken by the North in the welfare of the negro. It was
      established just as the war was closing and arose out of the various
      attempts to meet the negro problems that arose during the war. The Bureau
      had always a dual nature, due in part to its inheritance of regulations,
      precedents, and traditions from the various attempts made during war time
      to handle the many thousands of negroes who came under Federal control,
      and in part to the humanitarian impulses of 1865, born of a belief in the
      capacity of the negro for freedom and a suspicion that the Southern whites
      intended to keep as much of slavery as they could. The officials of the
      Bureau likewise were of two classes: those in control were for the most
      part army officers, standing as arbiters between white and black, usually
      just and seldom the victims of their sympathies; but the mass of less
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_099" id="Page_099">99</a></span>
			responsible officials were men of inferior ability and character, either
      blind partisans of the negro or corrupt and subject to purchase by the
      whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      In view of the fact that the Freedmen's Bureau was considered a new
      institution in 1865, it is rather remarkable how closely it followed in
      organization, purpose, and methods the precedents set during the war by
      the officers of the army and the Treasury. In Virginia, General Butler, in
      1861, declared escaped slaves to be "contraband" and proceeded to organize
      them into communities for discipline, work, food, and care. His successors
      in Virginia and North Carolina, and others in the Sea Islands of Georgia
      and South Carolina, extended his plan and arranged a labor system with
      fixed wages, hours, and methods of work, and everywhere made use of the
      captured or abandoned property of the Confederates. In Tennessee and
      Arkansas, Chaplain John Eaton of Grant's army employed thousands in a
      modified free labor system; and further down in Mississippi and Louisiana
      Generals Grant, Butler, and Banks also put large numbers of captured
      slaves to work for themselves and for the Government. Everywhere, as the
      numbers of negroes increased, the army commanders divided the occupied
      negro regions into
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
			districts under superintendents and other officials,
      framed labor laws, co&ouml;perated with benevolent societies which gave
      schooling and medical care to the blacks, and developed systems of
      government for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The United States Treasury Department, attempting to execute the
      confiscation laws for the benefit of the Treasury, appears now and then as
      an employer of negro labor on abandoned plantations. Either alone or in
      co&ouml;peration with the army and charitable associations, it even
			supervised negro colonies, and sometimes it assumed practically complete
			control of the economic welfare of the negro. This Department introduced
			in 1864 an elaborate lessee and trade system. The negro was regarded as
			"the ward of the nation," but he was told impressively that "labor is a
			public duty and idleness and vagrancy a crime." All wanted him to work:
			the Treasury wanted cotton and other crops to sell; the lessees and
			speculators wanted to make fortunes by his labor; and the army wanted to
			be free from the burden of the idle blacks. In spite of all these
			ministrations the negroes suffered much from harsh treatment, neglect, and
			unsanitary conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      During 1863 and 1864 several influences were
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
			urging the establishment of a national bureau or department to take charge
			of matters relating to the African race. Some wished to establish on the
			borders of the South a paid labor system, which might later be extended
			over the entire region, to get more slaves out of the Confederacy into
			this free labor territory, and to prevent immigration of negroes into the
			North, which, after the Emancipation Proclamation, was apprehensive of
			this danger. Others wished to relieve the army and the treasury officials
			of the burden of caring for the blacks and to protect the latter from the
			"northern harpies and bloodhounds" who had fastened upon them the lessee
			system.
    </p>
    <p>
      The discussion lasted for two years. The Freedmen's Inquiry Commission,
      after a survey of the field in 1863, recommended a consolidation of all
      efforts under an organization which should perpetuate the best features of
      the old system. But there was much opposition to this plan in Congress.
      The negroes would be exploited, objected some; the scheme gave too much
      power to the proposed organization, said others; another objection was
      urged against the employment of a horde of incompetent and unscrupulous
      officeholders, for "the men who go down there and become your overseers
      and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
			negro drivers will be your brokendown politicians and your
      dilapidated preachers, that description of men who are too lazy to work
      and just a little too honest to steal."
    </p>
    <p>
      As the war drew to a close the advocates of a policy of consolidation in
      negro affairs prevailed, and on March 3, 1865, an act was approved
      creating in the War Department a Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and
      Abandoned Lands. This Bureau was to continue for one year after the close
      of the war and it was to control all matters relating to freedmen and
      refugees, that is, Unionists who had been driven out of the South. Food,
      shelter, and clothing were to be given to the needy, and abandoned or
      confiscated property was to be used for or leased to freedmen. At the head
      of the Bureau was to be a commissioner with an assistant commissioner for
      each of the Southern States. These officials and other employees must take
      the "ironclad" oath.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was planned that the Bureau should have a brief existence, but the
      institution and its wards became such important factors in politics that
      on July 16, 1866, after a struggle with the President, Congress passed an
      act over his veto amplifying the powers of the Bureau and extending it for
      two
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
			years longer. This continuation of the Bureau was due to many things:
      to a belief that former slaveholders were not to be trusted in dealing
      with the negroes; to the baneful effect of the "Black Laws" upon Northern
      public opinion; to the struggle between the President and Congress over
      reconstruction; and to the foresight of radical politicians who saw in the
      institution an instrument for the political instruction of the blacks in
      the proper doctrines.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new law was supplementary to the Act of 1865, but its additional
      provisions merely endorsed what the Bureau was already doing. It
      authorized the issue of medical supplies, confirmed certain sales of land
      to negroes, and provided that the promises which Sherman made in 1865 to
      the Sea Island negroes should be carried out as far as possible and that
      no lands occupied by blacks should be restored to the owners until the
      crops of 1866 were gathered; it directed the Bureau to co&ouml;perate with
      private charitable and benevolent associations, and it authorized the use
      or sale for school purposes of all confiscated property; and finally it
      ordered that the civil equality of the negro be upheld by the Bureau and
      its courts when state courts refused to accept the principle. By
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
			later laws the existence of the Bureau was extended to January 1, 1869,
			in the unreconstructed States, but its educational and financial
			activities were continued until June 20, 1872.
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief objections to the Bureau from the conservative Northern point of
      view were summed up in the President's veto messages. The laws creating it
      were based, he asserted, on the theory that a state of war still existed;
      there was too great a concentration of power in the hands of a few
      individuals who could not be held responsible; with such a large number of
      agents ignorant of the country and often working for their own advantage
      injustice would inevitably result; in spite of the fact that the negro
      everywhere had a status in court, arbitrary tribunals were established,
      without jury, without regular procedure or rules of evidence, and without
      appeal; the provisions in regard to abandoned lands amounted to
      confiscation without a hearing; the negro, who must in the end work out
      his own salvation, and who was protected by the demand for his labor,
      would be deluded into thinking his future secure without further effort on
      his part; although nominally under the War Department, the Bureau was not
      subject to military control; it was practically a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
			great political machine; and, finally, the States most concerned were not
			represented in Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bureau was soon organized in all the former slaveholding States except
      Delaware, with general headquarters in Washington and state headquarters
      at the various capitals. General O.&nbsp;O. Howard, who was appointed
      commissioner, was a good officer, soft-hearted, honest, pious, and
      frequently referred to as "the Christian soldier." He was fair-minded and
      not disposed to irritate the Southern whites unnecessarily, but he was
      rather suspicious of their intentions toward the negroes, and he was a
      believer in the righteousness of the Freedmen's Bureau. He was not a good
      business man; and he was not beyond the reach of politicians. At one time
      he was seriously disturbed in his duties by the buzzing of the
      presidential bee in his bonnet. The members of his staff were not of his
      moral stature, and several of them were connected with commercial and
      political enterprises which left their motives open to criticism.
    </p>
    <p>
      The assistant commissioners were, as a rule, general officers of the army,
      though a few were colonels and chaplains. &sup1; Nearly half of them had
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
			during the war been associated with the various attempts to handle the
			negro problem, and it was these men who shaped the organization of the
			Bureau. While few of them were immediately acceptable to the Southern
			whites, only ten of them proved seriously objectionable on account of
			personality, character, or politics. Among the most able should be
			mentioned Generals Schofield, Swayne, Fullerton, Steedman, and Fessenden,
			and Colonel John Eaton. The President had little or no control over the
			appointment or discipline of the officials and agents of the Bureau,
			except possibly by calling some of the higher army officers back to
			military service.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_04-2" name="footer_04-2"></a>
&sup1; They numbered eleven at first and fourteen after July,
     1866, and were changed so often that fifty, in all, served
     in this rank before January 1, 1869, when the Bureau was
     practically discontinued.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      As a result of General Grant's severe criticism of the arrangement which
      removed the Bureau from control by the military establishment, the
      military commander was in a few instances also appointed assistant
      commissioner. Each assistant commissioner was aided by a headquarters
      staff and had under his jurisdiction in each State various district,
      county, and local agents, with a special corps of school officials, who
      were usually teachers and missionaries belonging to religious and
      charitable societies. The local agents were recruited from the members of
      the Veteran Reserve Corps,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
			the subordinate officers and non-commissioned
      officers of the army, mustered-out soldiers, officers of negro troops,
      preachers, teachers, and Northern civilians who had come South. As a class
      these agents were not competent persons to guide the blacks in the ways of
      liberty or to arbitrate differences between the races. There were many
      exceptions, but the Southern view as expressed by General Wade Hampton had
      only too much foundation: "There <em>may</em> be," he said, "an honest man
      connected with the Bureau." John Minor Botts, a Virginian who had remained
      loyal to the Union, asserted that many of the agents were good men who did
      good work but that trouble resulted from the ignorance and fanaticism of
      others. The minority members of the Ku Klux Committee condemned the agents
      as being "generally of a class of fanatics without character or
      responsibility."
    </p>
    <p>
      The chief activities of the Bureau included the following five branches:
      relief work for both races; the regulation of negro labor; the
      administration of justice in cases concerning negroes; the management of
      abandoned and confiscated property; and the support of schools for the
      negroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relief work which was carried on for more than four years consisted of
      caring for sick negroes
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
			who were within reach of the hospitals, furnishing
      food and sometimes clothing and shelter to destitute blacks and whites,
      and transporting refugees of both races back to their homes. Nearly a
      hundred hospitals and clinics were established, and half a million
      patients were treated. This work was greatly needed, especially for the
      old and the infirm, and it was well done. The transportation of refugees
      did not reach large proportions, and after 1866 it was entangled in
      politics. But the issue of supplies in huge quantities brought much needed
      relief though at the same time a certain amount of demoralization. The
      Bureau claimed little credit, and is usually given none, for keeping alive
      during the fall and winter of 1865-1866 thousands of destitute whites. Yet
      more than a third of the food issued was to whites, and without it many
      would have starved. Numerous Confederate soldiers on the way home after
      the surrender were fed by the Bureau, and in the destitute white districts
      a great deal of suffering was relieved and prevented by its operations.
      The negroes, dwelling for the most part in regions where labor was in
      demand, needed relief for a shorter time, but they were attracted in
      numbers to the towns by free food, and it was difficult to get them back
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
      to work. The political value of the free food issues was not generally
      recognized until later in 1866 and in 1867.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the first year of the Bureau an important duty of the agents was
      the supervision of negro labor and the fixing of wages. Both officials and
      planters generally demanded that contracts be written, approved, and filed
      in the office of the Bureau. They thought that the negroes would work
      better if they were thus bound by contracts. The agents usually required
      that the agreements between employer and laborer cover such points as the
      nature of the work, the hours, food and clothes, medical attendance,
      shelter, and wages. To make wages secure, the laborer was given a lien on
      the crop; to secure the planter from loss, unpaid wages might be forfeited
      if the laborer failed to keep his part of the contract. When it dawned
      upon the Bureau authorities that other systems of labor had been or might
      be developed in the South, they permitted arrangements for the various
      forms of cash and share renting. But it was everywhere forbidden to place
      the negroes under "overseers" or to subject them to "unwilling
      apprenticeship" and "compulsory working out of debts."
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
			The written contract system for laborers did not work out successfully.
			The negroes at first were expecting quite other fruits of freedom. One
			Mississippi negro voiced what was doubtless the opinion of many when he
			declared that he "considered no man free who had to work for a living."
			Few negroes would contract for more than three months and none for a
			period beyond January 1, 1866, when they expected a division of lands
			among the ex-slaves. In spite of the regulations, most worked on oral
			agreements. In 1866 nearly all employers threw overboard the written
			contract system for labor and permitted oral agreements. Some States
			had passed stringent laws for the enforcing of contracts, but in Alabama,
			Governor Patton vetoed such legislation on the ground that it was not
			needed. General Swayne, the Bureau chief for the State, endorsed the
			Governor's action and stated that the negro was protected by his freedom
			to leave when mistreated, and the planter, by the need on the part of
			the negro for food and shelter. Negroes, he said, were afraid of
			contracts and, besides, contracts led to litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to safeguard the civil rights of the negroes the Bureau was
      given authority to establish
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
			courts of its own and to supervise the action of state courts in cases to
			which freedmen were parties. The majority of the assistant commissioners
			made no attempt to let the state courts handle negro cases but were
			accustomed to bring all such cases before the Bureau or the provost courts
			of the army. In Alabama, quite early, and later in North Carolina,
			Mississippi, and Georgia, the wiser assistant commissioners arranged for
			the state courts to handle freedmen's cases with the understanding that
			discriminating laws were to be suspended. General Swayne in so doing
			declared that he was "unwilling to establish throughout Alabama courts
			conducted by persons foreign to her citizenship and strangers to her
			laws." The Bureau courts were informal affairs, consisting usually of one
			or two administrative officers. There were no jury, no appeal beyond the
			assistant commissioner, no rules of procedure, and no accepted body of
			law. In state courts accepted by the Bureau the proceedings in negro
			cases were conducted in the same manner as for the whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The educational work of the Bureau was at first confined to
			co&ouml;peration with such Northern religious and benevolent societies as
			were organizing schools and churches for the negroes. After
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
			the first year the Bureau extended financial aid and undertook a system
			of supervision over negro schools. The teachers employed were Northern
			whites and negroes in about equal numbers. Confiscated Confederate
			property was devoted to negro education, and in several States the
			assistant commissioners collected fees and percentages of the negroes'
			wages for the benefit of the schools. In addition the Bureau expended
			about six million dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The intense dislike which the Southern whites manifested for the
      Freedmen's Bureau was due in general to their resentment of outside
      control of domestic affairs and in particular to unavoidable difficulties
      inherent in the situation. Among the concrete causes of Southern hostility
      was the attitude of some of the higher officials and many of the lower
      ones toward the white people. They assumed that the whites were unwilling
      to accord fair treatment to the blacks in the matter of wages, schools,
      and justice. An official in Louisiana declared that the whites would
      exterminate the negroes if the Bureau were removed. A few months later
      General Fullerton in the same State reported that trouble was caused by
      those agents who noisily demanded special privileges for the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
			negro but who objected to any penalties for his lawlessness and made of
			the negroes a pampered class. General Tillson in Georgia predicted the
			extinction of the "old time Southerner with his hate, cruelty, and
			malice." General Fisk declared that "there are some of the meanest,
			unsubjugated and unreconstructed rascally revolutionists in Kentucky that
			curse the soil of the country &hellip; a more select number of vindictive,
			pro-slavery, rebellious legislators cannot be found than a majority of the
			Kentucky legislature." There was a disposition to lecture the whites about
			their sins in regard to slavery and to point out to them how far in their
			general ignorance and backwardness they fell short of enlightened people.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Bureau courts were frequently conducted in an "illegal and oppressive
      manner," with "decided partiality for the colored people, without regard
      to justice." For this reason they were suspended for a time in Louisiana
      and Georgia by General Steedman and General Fullerton, and cases were then
      sent before military courts. Men of the highest character were dragged
      before the Bureau tribunals upon frivolous complaints, were lectured,
      abused, ridiculed, and arbitrarily fined or otherwise punished. The
      jurisdiction of the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
			Bureau courts weakened the civil courts and their frequent interference
			in trivial matters was not conducive to a return to normal conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inferior agents, not sufficiently under the control of their
      superiors, were responsible for a great deal of this bad feeling. Many of
      them held radical opinions as to the relations of the races, and
      inculcated these views in their courts, in the schools, and in the new
      negro churches. Some were charged with even causing strikes and other
      difficulties in order to be bought off by the whites. The tendency of
      their work was to create in the negroes a pervasive distrust of the
      whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The prevalent delusion in regard to an impending division of the lands
      among the blacks had its origin in the operation of the war-time
      confiscation laws, in some of the Bureau legislation, and in General
      Sherman's Sea Island order, but it was further fostered by the agents
      until most blacks firmly believed that each head of a family was to get
      "40 acres and a mule." This belief seriously interfered with industry and
      resulted also in widespread swindling by rascals who for years made a
      practice of selling fraudulent deeds to land with red, white, and blue
      sticks to mark off the bounds of a chosen spot on the former master's
      plantation. The
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
			assistant commissioners labored hard to disabuse the minds
      of the negroes, but their efforts were often neutralized by the
      unscrupulous attitude of the agents.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the contest over reconstruction developed in Washington, the officials
      of the Bureau soon recognized the political possibilities of their
      institution. After mid-year of 1866, the Bureau became a political machine
      for the purpose of organizing the blacks into the Union League, where the
      rank and file were taught that re&euml;nslavement would follow Democratic
      victories. Nearly all of the Bureau agents aided in the administration of
      the reconstruction acts in 1867 and in the organization of the new state
      and local governments and became officials under the new r&eacute;gime.
			They were the chief agents in capturing the solid negro vote for the
			Republican party.
    </p>
		<hr class="break"/>
    <p>
      Neither of the two plans for guiding the freedmen into a place in the
      social order&mdash;the "Black Laws" and the Freedmen's Bureau&mdash;was
      successful. The former contained a program which was better suited to
      actual conditions and which might have succeeded if it had been given a
      fair trial. These laws were a measure of the extent to which
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
			the average
      white would then go in "accepting the situation" so far as the blacks were
      concerned. And on the whole the recognition of negro rights made in these
      laws, and made at a time when the whites believed that they were free to
      handle the situation, was remarkably fair. The negroes lately released
      from slavery were admitted to the enjoyment of the same rights as the
      whites as to legal protection of life, liberty, and property, as to
      education and as to the family relation, limited only by the clear
      recognition of the principles of political inferiority and social
      separation. Unhappily this legislation was not put to the test of
      practical experience because of the Freedmen's Bureau; it was nevertheless
      skillfully used to arouse the dominant Northern party to a course of
      action which made impossible any further effort to treat the race problem
      with due consideration to actual local conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the work of the Freedmen's Bureau was of only temporary benefit to
      both races. The results of its more permanent work were not generally
      good. The institution was based upon the assumption that the negro race
      must be protected from the white race. In its organization and
      administration it was an impossible combination of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
			the practical and the theoretical, of opportunism and humanitarianism, of
			common sense and idealism. It failed to exert a permanently wholesome
			influence because its lesser agents were not held to strict accountability
			by their superiors. Under these agents the alienation of the two races
			began, and the ill feelings then aroused were destined to persist into a
			long and troubled future.

      soldiers who fought through the war to victory or to defeat had been
      at home nearly two years before the radicals developed sufficient strength
      to carry through their plans for a revolutionary reconstruction of the
      Southern States. At the end of the war a majority of the Northern people
      would have supported a settlement in accordance with Lincoln's policy.
      Eight months later a majority, but a smaller one, would have supported
      Johnson's work had it been possible to secure a popular decision on it.
      How then did the radicals gain the victory over the conservatives? The
      answer to this question is given by James Ford Rhodes in terms of
      personalities: "Three men are responsible for the Congressional policy of
      Reconstruction: Andrew Johnson, by his obstinacy and bad behavior;
      Thaddeus Stevens,

      Radicalism did not begin in the Administration of Andrew Johnson. Lincoln
      had felt its covert opposition throughout the war, but he possessed the
      faculty of weakening his opponents, while Johnson's conduct usually
      multiplied the number and the strength of his enemies. At first the
      radicals criticized Lincoln's policy in regard to slavery, and after the
      Emancipation Proclamation they shifted their attack to his "ten per cent"
      plan for organizing the state governments as outlined in the Proclamation
      of December, 1863. Lincoln's course was distasteful to them because he did
      not admit the right of Congress to dictate terms, because of his liberal
      attitude towards former Confederates, and because he was conservative on
      the negro question. A schism among the Republican supporters of the war
      was with difficulty averted in 1864, when Fr&eacute;mont threatened to
			lead the radicals in opposition to the "Union" party of the President
			and his conservative policy.
    </p>
    <p>
      The breach was widened by the refusal of Congress to admit representatives
      from Arkansas and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
			Louisiana in 1864 and to count the electoral vote of Louisiana and
			Tennessee in 1865. The passage of the Wade-Davis reconstruction bill in
			July, 1864, and the protests of its authors after Lincoln's pocket veto
			called attention to the growing opposition. Severe criticism caused
			Lincoln to withdraw the propositions which he had made in April, 1865,
			with regard to the restoration of Virginia. In his last public
      speech he referred with regret to the growing spirit of vindictiveness
      toward the South. Much of the opposition to Lincoln's Southern policy was
      based not on radicalism, that is, not on any desire for a revolutionary
      change in the South, but upon a belief that Congress and not the Executive
      should be entrusted with the work of reorganizing the Union. Many
      congressional leaders were willing to have Congress itself carry through
      the very policies which Lincoln had advocated; and a majority of the
      Northern people would have endorsed them without much caring who was to
      execute them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The murder of Lincoln, the failure of the radicals to shape Johnson's
      policy as they had hoped, and the continuing reaction against the
      excessive expansion of the executive power added strength to the
      opposition. But it was a long fight before the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
			radical leaders won. Their victory was due to adroit tactics on their own
		  part and to mistakes, bad judgment, and bad manners on the part of the
			President. When all hope of controlling Johnson had been given up,
			Thaddeus Stevens and other leaders of similar views began to contrive
			means to circumvent him. On December 1, 1865, before Congress met, a
			caucus of radicals held in Washington agreed that a joint committee of the
			two Houses should be selected to which should be referred matters relating
			to reconstruction. This plan would thwart the more conservative Senate and
			gain a desirable delay in which the radicals might develop their campaign.
			The next day at a caucus of the Union party the plan went through without
			arousing the suspicion of the supporters of the Administration. Next,
			through the influence of Stevens, Edward McPherson, the clerk of the
			House, omitted from the roll call of the House the names of the members
			from the South. The radical program was then adopted and a week later the
			Senate concurred in the action of the House as to the appointment of a
			Joint Committee on Reconstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the issues before Congress both Houses were split into rather clearly
      defined factions:
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
			the extreme radicals with such leaders as Stevens, Sumner, Wade, and
			Boutwell; the moderate Republicans, chief among whom were Fessenden and
			Trumbull; the administration Republicans led by Raymond, Doolittle, Cowan,
			and Dixon; and the Democrats, of whom the ablest were Reverdy Johnson,
			Guthrie, and Hendricks. All except the extreme radicals were willing to
			support the President or to come to some fairly reasonable compromise. But
			at no time were they given an opportunity to get together. Johnson and the
			administration leaders did little in this direction and the radicals made
			the most skillful use of the divisions among the conservatives.

    <p>
      Whatever final judgment may be passed upon the radical reconstruction
      policy and its results, there can be no doubt of the political dexterity
      of those who carried it through. Chief among them was Thaddeus Stevens,
      vindictive and unscrupulous, filled with hatred of the Southern leaders,
      bitter in speech and possessing to an extreme degree the faculty of making
      ridiculous those who opposed him. He advocated confiscation, the
      proscription or exile of leading whites, the granting of the franchise and
      of lands to the negroes, and in Southern States the establishment of
      territorial
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
			governments under the control of Congress. These States should, he said,
			"never be recognized as capable of acting in the Union &hellip;
      until the Constitution shall have been so amended as to make it what the
      makers intended, and so as to secure perpetual ascendancy to the party of
      the Union."
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Sumner, the leader of the radicals in the Senate, was moved less
      than Stevens by personal hostility toward the whites of the South, but his
      sympathy was reserved entirely for the blacks. He was unpractical,
      theoretical, and not troubled by constitutional scruples. To him the
      Declaration of Independence was the supreme law and it was the duty of
      Congress to express its principles in appropriate legislation. Unlike
      Stevens, who had a genuine liking for the negro, Sumner's sympathy for the
      race was purely intellectual; for the individual negro he felt repulsion.
      His views were in effect not different from those of Stevens. And he was
      practical enough not to overlook the value of the negro vote. "To my
      mind," he said, "nothing is clearer than the absolute necessity of
      suffrage for all colored persons in the disorganized States. It will not
      be enough if you give it to those who read and write; you will not, in
      this way, acquire the voting force which you need there for
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
			the protection of unionists, whether white or black. You will not secure
			the new allies who are essential to the national cause." A leader of the
			second rank was his colleague Henry Wilson, who was also actuated by a
			desire for the negro's welfare and for the perpetuation of the Republican
			party, which he said contained in its ranks "more of moral and
			intellectual worth than was ever embodied in any political organization
			in any land &hellip; created by no man or set of men but brought into
			being by Almighty God himself &hellip; and endowed by the Creator with all
			political power and every office under Heaven." Shellabarger of Ohio was
		  another important figure among the radicals. The following extract from
			one of his speeches gives an indication of his character and temperament:
			"They [the Confederates] framed iniquity and universal murder into
			law.&hellip; Their pirates burned your unarmed commerce upon every sea.
			They carved the bones of the dead heroes into ornaments, and drank from
			goblets made out of their skulls. They poisoned your fountains, put mines
			under your soldiers' prisons; organized bands whose leaders were concealed
			in your homes; and commissions ordered the torch and yellow fever to be
			carried to your cities and to your women and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
			children. They planned one universal bonfire of the North from Lake
			Ontario to the Missouri."
    </p>
    <p>
      Among the lesser lights may be mentioned Morton and Wade, both bluff,
      coarse, and ungenerous, and thoroughly convinced that the Republican party
      had a monopoly of loyalty, wisdom, and virtues, and that by any means it
      must gain and keep control; Boutwell, fanatical and mediocre; and Benjamin
      Butler, a charlatan and demagogue. As a class the Western radicals were
      less troubled by humanitarian ideals than were those of the East and
      sought more practical political results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Joint Committee on Reconstruction which finally decided the fate of
      the Southern States was composed of eight radicals, four moderate
      Republicans, and three Democrats. As James Gillespie Blaine wrote later,
      "it was foreseen that in an especial degree the fortunes of the Republican
      party would be in the keeping of the fifteen men who might be chosen."
      This committee was divided into four subcommittees to take testimony. The
      witnesses, all of whom were examined at Washington, included army officers
      and Bureau agents who had served in the South, Southern Unionists, a few
      politicians, and several former Confederates, among them General Robert E.
      Lee and Alexander
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
			H. Stephens. Most of the testimony was of the kind needed to support the
			contentions of the radicals that negroes were badly treated in the South;
			that the whites were disloyal; that, should they be left in control, the
			negro, free labor, the nation, and the Republican party would be in
			danger; that the army and the Freedmen's Bureau must be kept in the South;
			and that a radical reconstruction was necessary. No serious effort,
			however, was made to ascertain the actual conditions in the South. Slow to
			formulate a definite plan, the Joint Committee guided public sentiment
			toward radicalism, converted gradually the Republican Congressmen, and
			little by little undermined the power and influence of the President.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until after the new year was it plain that there was to be a fight to
      the finish between Congress and the President. Congress had refused in
      December, 1865, to accept the President's program, but there was still hope
      for a compromise. Many conservatives had voted for the delay merely to
      assert the rights of Congress; but the radicals wanted time to frame a
      program. The Northern Democrats were embarrassingly cordial in their
      support of Johnson and so also were most Southerners. The moderates were
      not far away
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
			from the position of the President and the administration Republicans. But
			the radicals skillfully postponed a test of strength until Stevens and
			Sumner were ready. The latter declared that a generation must elapse
			"before the rebel communities have so far been changed as to become safe
			associates in a common government. Time, therefore, we must have. Through
			time all other guarantees may be obtained; but time itself is a
			guarantee."
    </p>
    <p>
      To the Joint Committee were referred without debate all measures relating
      to reconstruction, but the Committee was purposely making little
			progress&mdash;contented merely to take testimony and to act as a clearing
			house for the radical "facts" about "Southern outrages" while waiting for
			the tide to turn. The "Black Laws" and the election of popular Confederate
			leaders to office in the South were effectively used to alarm the friends
			of the negroes, and the reports from the Bureau agents gave support to
			those who condemned the Southern state governments as totally inadequate
			and disloyal.
    </p>
    <p>
      So apparent was the growth of radicalism that the President, alarmed by
      the attitude of Sumner and Stevens and their followers, began to fear for
      the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
			Constitution and forced the fight. The passage of a bill on February
      6, 1866, extending the life of the Freedmen's Bureau furnished the
      occasion for the beginning of the open struggle. On the 19th of February
      Johnson vetoed the bill, and the next day an effort was made to pass it
      over the veto. Not succeeding in this attempt, the House of
      Representatives adopted a concurrent resolution that Senators and
      Representatives from the Southern States should be excluded until Congress
      declared them entitled to representation. Ten days later the Senate also
      adopted the resolution.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though it was not yet too late for Johnson to meet the conservatives of
      Congress on middle ground, he threw away his opportunity by an intemperate
      and undignified speech on the 22d of February to a crowd at the White
      House. As usual when excited, he forgot the proprieties and denounced the
      radicals as enemies of the Union and even went so far as to charge
      Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips with endeavoring to destroy the
      fundamental principles of the government. Such conduct weakened his
      supporters and rejoiced his enemies. It was expected that Johnson would
      approve the bill to confer civil rights upon the negroes, but, goaded
      perhaps by the speeches of Stevens,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
			he vetoed it on the 27th of March. Its patience now exhausted, Congress
			passed the bill over the President's veto. To secure the requisite
			majority in the Senate, Stockton, Democratic Senator from New Jersey, was
			unseated on technical grounds, and Senator Morgan, who was "paired" with
			a sick colleague, broke his word to vote aye&mdash;for which Wade
			offensively thanked God. The moderates had now fallen away from the
      President and at least for this session of Congress his policies
      were wrecked. On the 16th of July the supplementary Freedmen's Bureau Act
      was passed over the veto, and on the 24th of July Tennessee was readmitted
      to representation by a law the preamble of which asserted unmistakably
      that Congress had assumed control of reconstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile the Joint Committee on Reconstruction had made a report
      asserting that the Southerners had forfeited all constitutional rights,
      that their state governments were not in constitutional form, and that
      restoration could be accomplished only when Congress and the President
      acted together in fixing the terms of readmission. The uncompromising
      hostility of the South, the Committee asserted, made necessary adequate
      safeguards which should include the disfranchisement
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
			of the white leaders, either negro suffrage or a reduction of white
			representation, and repudiation of the Confederate war debt with
			recognition of the validity of the United States debt. These terms were
			embodied in the Fourteenth Amendment, which was adopted by Congress and
			sent to the States on June 13, 1866.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the congressional campaign of 1866 reconstruction was almost the sole
      issue. For success the Administration must gain at least one-third of one
      house, while the radicals were fighting for two-thirds of each House. If
      the Administration should fail to make the necessary gain, the work
      accomplished by the Presidents would be destroyed. The campaign was bitter
      and extended through the summer and fall. Four national conventions were
      held: the National Union party at Philadelphia made a respectable showing
      in support of the President; the Southern Unionists, guided by the
      Northern radicals met at the same place; a soldiers' and sailors'
      convention at Cleveland supported the Administration; and another
      convention of soldiers and sailors at Pittsburgh endorsed the radical
      policies. A convention of Confederate soldiers and sailors at Memphis
      endorsed the President, but the Southern support
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
			and that of the Northern Democrats did not encourage moderate Republicans
			to vote for the Administration. Three members of Johnson's
			Cabinet&mdash;Harlan, Speed, and Dennison&mdash;resigned because they were
			unwilling to follow their chief further in opposing Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radicals had plenty of campaign material in the testimony collected by
      the Joint Committee, in the reports of the Freedmen's Bureau, and in the
      bloody race riots which had occurred in Memphis and New Orleans. The
      greatest blunder of the Administration was Johnson's speechmaking tour to
      the West which he called "Swinging Around the Circle." Every time he made
      a speech he was heckled by persons in the crowd, lost his temper,
      denounced Congress and the radical leaders, and conducted himself in an
      undignified manner. The election returns showed more than a two-thirds
      majority in each House against the President. The Fortieth Congress would
      therefore be safely radical, and in consequence the Thirty-ninth was
      encouraged to be more radical during its last session.
    </p>
    <p>
      Public interest now for a time turned to the South, where the Fourteenth
      Amendment was before the state legislatures. The radicals, taunted with
      having no plan of reconstruction beyond a
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
			desire to keep the Southern States out of the Union, professed to see in
			the ratification of the Fourteenth Amendment a good opportunity to readmit
			the States on a safe basis. The elections of 1866 had pointed to the
			ratification of the proposed amendment as an essential preliminary to
			readmission. But would additional demands be made upon the South? Sumner,
			Stevens, and Fessenden were sure that negro suffrage also must come, but
			Wade, Chase, Garfield, and others believed that nothing beyond the terms
			of the Fourteenth Amendment would be asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the Southern legislatures there was little disposition to ratify the
      amendment. The rapid development of the radical policies during 1866 had
      convinced most Southerners that nothing short of a general humiliation and
      complete revolution in the South would satisfy the dominant party, and
      there were few who wished to be "parties to our own dishonor." The
      President advised the States not to accept the amendment, but several
      Southern leaders favored it, fearing that worse would come if they should
      reject it. Only in the legislatures of Alabama and Florida was there any
      serious disposition to accept the amendment; and in the end all the
      unreconstructed States voted adversely
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
			during the fall and winter of 1866-67. This unanimity of action was due
			in part to the belief that, even if the amendment were ratified, the
			Southern States would still be excluded, and in part to the general
			dislike of the proscriptive section which would disfranchise all
			Confederates of prominence and result in the breaking up of the state
			governments. The example of unhappy Tennessee, which had ratified the
			Fourteenth Amendment and had been readmitted, was not one to encourage
			conservative people in the other Southern States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rejection of the amendment put the question of reconstruction squarely
      before Congress. There was no longer a possibility of accomplishing the
      reconstruction of the Southern States by means of constitutional
      amendments. Some of the Border and Northern States were already showing
      signs of uneasiness at the continued exclusion of the South. But if the
      Constitutional Amendment had failed, other means of reconstruction were at
      hand, for the radicals now controlled the Thirty-ninth Congress, from
      which the Southern representatives were excluded, and would also control
      the Fortieth Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      Under the lead of Stevens and Sumner the radicals now perfected their
      plans. On January 8, 1867,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
			their first measure, conferring the franchise upon negroes in the
			District of Columbia, was passed over the presidential veto, though the
			proposal had been voted down a few weeks earlier by a vote of 6525 to
			35 in Washington and 812 to 1 in Georgetown. In the next place, by an
			act of January 31, 1867, the franchise was extended to negroes in the
			territories, and on March 2, 1867, three important measures were enacted:
			the Tenure of Office Act and a rider to the Army Appropriation
			Act&mdash;both designed to limit the power of the President&mdash;and the
			first Reconstruction Act. By the Tenure of Office Act the President was
			prohibited from removing officeholders except with the consent of the
      Senate; and by the Army Act he was forbidden to issue orders except
      through General Grant or to relieve him of command or to assign him to
      command away from Washington unless at the General's own request or with
      the previous approval of the Senate. The first measure was meant to check
      the removal of radical officeholders by Johnson, and the other, which was
      secretly drawn up for Boutwell by Stanton, was designed to prevent the
      President from exercising his constitutional command of the army.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first Reconstruction Act declared that no
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
			legal state government existed in the ten unreconstructed States and that
			there was no adequate protection for life and property. The Johnson and
			Lincoln governments in those States were declared to have no legal status
			and to be subject wholly to the authority of the United States to modify
			or abolish. The ten States were divided into five military districts, over
			each of which a general officer was to be placed in command. Military
			tribunals were to supersede the civil courts where necessary. Stevens was
			willing to rest here, though some of his less radical followers, disliking
			military rule but desiring to force negro suffrage, inserted a provision
			in the law that a State might be readmitted to representation upon the
			following conditions: a constitutional convention must be held, the
			members of which were elected by males of voting age without regard to
			color, excluding whites who would be disfranchised by the proposed
			Fourteenth Amendment; a constitution including the same rule of suffrage
			must be framed, ratified by the same electorate, and approved by Congress;
			and lastly, the legislatures elected under this constitution must ratify
			the proposed Fourteenth Amendment, after which, if the Fourteenth
			Amendment should have become a part of the Federal
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
			Constitution, the State should be readmitted to representation.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order that the administration of this radical legislation might be
      supervised by its friends, the Thirty-ninth Congress had passed a law
      requiring the Fortieth Congress to meet on the 4th of March instead of in
      December as was customary. According to the Reconstruction Act of the 2nd
      of March it was left to the state government or to the people of a State
      to make the first move towards reconstruction. If they preferred, they
      might remain under military rule. Either by design or by carelessness no
      machinery of administration was provided for the execution of the act.
      When it became evident that the Southerners preferred military rule the
      new Congress passed a Supplementary Reconstruction Act on the 23d of March
      designed to force the earlier act into operation. The five commanding
      generals were directed to register the blacks of voting age and the whites
      who were not disfranchised, to hold elections for conventions, to call the
      conventions, to hold elections to ratify or reject the constitutions, and
      to forward the constitutions, if ratified, to the President for
      transmission to Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      In these reconstruction acts the whole doctrine
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
			of radicalism was put on the way to accomplishment. Its spread had been
			rapid. In December, 1865, the majority of Congress would have accepted
			with little modification the work of Lincoln and Johnson. Three months
			later the Civil Rights Act measured the advance. Very soon the new
			Freedmen's Bureau Act and the Fourteenth Amendment indicated the rising
			tide of radicalism. The campaign of 1866 and the attitude of the Southern
			States swept all radicals and most moderate Republicans swiftly into a
			merciless course of reconstruction. Moderate reconstruction had nowhere
			strong support. Congress, touched in its <i>amour propre</i> by
			presidential disregard, was eager for extremes. Johnson, who regarded
			himself as defending the Constitution against radical assaults, was
			stubborn, irascible, and undignified, and with his associates was no
			match in political strategy for his radical opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average Republican or Unionist in the North, if he had not been
      brought by skillful misrepresentation to believe a new rebellion impending
      in the South, was at any rate painfully alive to the fear that the
      Democratic party might regain power. With the freeing of the slaves the
      representation of the South in Congress would be
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
			increased. At first it seemed that the South might divide in politics as
			before the war, but the longer the delay the more the Southern whites
			tended to unite into one party acting with the Democrats. With their
			eighty-five representatives and a slight reaction in the North, they might
			gain control of the lower House of Congress. The Union-Republican party
			had a majority of less than one hundred in 1866 and this was lessened
			slightly in the Fortieth Congress. The President was for all practical
			purposes a Democrat again. The prospect was too much for the very human
			politicians to view without distress. Stevens, speaking in support of the
			Military Reconstruction Bill, said:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      There are several good reasons for the passage of this bill. In the first
      place, it is just. I am now confining my argument to negro suffrage in the
      rebel States. Have not loyal blacks quite as good a right to choose rulers
      and make laws as rebel whites? In the second place, it is necessary in
      order to protect the loyal white men in the seceded States. With them the
      blacks would act in a body, and it is believed that in each of these
      States, except one, the two united would form a majority, control the
      States, and protect themselves. Now they are the victims of daily murder.
      They must suffer constant persecution or be exiled. Another good reason is

      The laws passed on the 2d and the 23d of March were war measures and
      presupposed a continuance of war conditions. The Lincoln-Johnson state
      governments were overturned; Congress fixed the qualifications of voters
      for that time and for the future; and the President, shorn of much of his
      constitutional power, could exercise but little control over the military
      government. Nothing that a State might do would secure restoration until
      it should ratify the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution. The
      war had been fought upon the theory that the old Union must be preserved;
      but the basic theory of the reconstruction was that a new Union was to be
      created.

    </h2>
		<p class="chaptertitle">The Rule of the Major Generals</p>
		<p class="noindent"><span class="first-word">From</span>
      the passage of the reconstruction acts to the close of Johnson's
      Administration, Congress, working the will of the radical majority, was in
      supreme control. The army carried out the will of Congress and to that
      body, not to the President, the commanding general and his subordinates
      looked for direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official opposition of the President to the policy of Congress ceased
      when that policy was enacted into law. He believed this legislation to be
      unconstitutional, but he considered it his duty to execute the laws. He at
      once set about the appointment of generals to command the military
      districts created in the South, &sup1; a task
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
			calling for no little discretion, since much depended upon the character
			of these military governors, or "satraps," as they were frequently called
			by the opposition. The commanding general in a district was charged with
			many duties, military, political, and administrative. It was his duty to
			carry on a government satisfactory to the radicals and not too irritating
			to the Southern whites; at the same time he must execute the
			reconstruction acts by putting old leaders out of power and negroes in.
			Violent opposition to this policy on the part of the South was not looked
			for. Notwithstanding the "Southern outrage" campaign, it was generally
			recognized in government circles that conditions in the seceded States had
			gradually been growing better since the close of the war. There was in
			many regions, to be sure, a general laxity in enforcing laws, but that had
			always been characteristic of the newer parts of the South. The Civil
			Rights Act was generally in force, the "Black Laws" had been suspended,
			and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
			the Freedmen's Bureau was everywhere caring for the negroes. What disorder
      existed was of recent origin and in the main was due to the unsettling
      effects of the debates in Congress and to the organization of the negroes
      for political purposes.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_06-1" name="footer_06-1"></a>
&sup1; The first five generals appointed were Schofield, Sickles,
     Pope, Ord, and Sheridan. None of these remained in his
     district until reconstruction was completed. To Schofield's
     command in the first district succeeded in turn Stoneman,
     Webb, and Canby; Sickles gave way to Canby, and Pope to
     Meade; Ord in the fourth district was followed by Gillem,
     McDowell, and Ames; Sheridan, in the fifth, was succeeded by
     Griffen, Mower, Hancock, Buchanan, Reynolds, and Canby. Some
     of the generals were radical; others, moderate and tactful.
     The most extreme were Sheridan, Pope, and Sickles. Those
     most acceptable to the whites were Hancock, Schofield, and
     Meade. General Grant himself became more radical in his
     actions as he became involved in the fight between Congress
     and the President.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      Military rule was established in the South with slight friction, but it
      was soon found that the reconstruction laws were not sufficiently clear on
      two points: first, whether there was any limit to the authority of the
      five generals over the local and state governments and, if so, whether the
      limiting authority was in the President; and second, whether the
      disfranchising provisions in the laws were punitive and hence to be
      construed strictly. Attorney-General Stanbery, in May and June, 1867, drew
      up opinions in which he maintained that the laws were to be considered
      punitive and therefore to be construed strictly. After discussions in
      cabinet meetings these opinions received the approval of all except
      Stanton, Secretary of War, who had already joined the radical camp. The
      Attorney-General's opinion was sent out to the district commanders for
      their information and guidance. But Congress did not intend to permit the
      President or his Cabinet to direct the process of reconstruction, and in
      the Act of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
			July 19, 1867, it gave a radical interpretation to the
      reconstruction legislation, declared itself in control, gave full power to
      General Grant and to the district commanders subject only to Grant,
      directed the removal of all local officials who opposed the reconstruction
      policies, and warned the civil and military officers of the United States
      that none of them should "be bound in his action by any opinion of any
      civil officer of the United States." This interpretive legislation gave a
      broad basis for the military government and resulted in a severe
      application of the disfranchising provisions of the laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      The rule of the five generals lasted in all the States until June, 1868,
      and continued in Mississippi, Texas, Virginia, and Georgia until 1870.
      There had been, to be sure, some military government in 1865, subject,
      however, to the President, and from 1865 to 1867 the army, along with the
      Freedmen's Bureau, had exerted a strong influence in the government of the
      South, but in the r&eacute;gime now inaugurated the military was supreme.
			The generals had a superior at Washington, but whether it was the
			President, General Grant, or Congress was not clear until the Act of July
			19, 1867 made Congress the source of authority.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
      The power of the generals most strikingly appeared in their control of the
      state governments which were continued as provisional organizations. Since
      no elections were permitted, all appointments and removals were made from
      military headquarters, which soon became political beehives, centers of
      wirepulling and agencies for the distribution of spoils. At the outset
      civil officers were ordered to retain their offices during good behavior,
      subject to military control. But no local official was permitted to use
      his influence ever so slightly against reconstruction. Since most of them
      did not favor the policy of Congress, thousands were removed as "obstacles
      to reconstruction." The Governors of Georgia, Louisiana, Virginia,
      Mississippi, and Texas were displaced and others appointed in their stead.
      All kinds of subordinate offices rapidly became vacant. New appointments
      were nearly always carpetbaggers and native radicals who could take the
      "ironclad" oath. The generals complained that there were not enough
      competent native "loyalists" to fill the offices, and frequently an army
      officer was installed as governor, treasurer, secretary of state, auditor,
      or mayor. In nearly all towns the police force was reorganized and
      former Federal soldiers were added to the force, while the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
			regular troops were used for general police purposes and for rural
			constabulary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the administration of justice the military authorities exercised a
      close supervision. Instructions were sent out to court officers covering
      the selection of juries, the suspension of certain laws, and the rules of
      evidence and procedure. Courts were often closed, court decrees set aside
      or modified, prisoners released, and many cases reserved for trial by
      military commission. Some commanders required juries to admit negro
      members and insisted that all jurors take the "ironclad" test oath. There
      was some attempt at regulating the Federal courts but without much
      success.
    </p>
    <p>
      Since the state legislatures were forbidden to meet, much legislation was
      enacted through military orders. Stay laws were enacted, the color line
      was abolished, new criminal regulations were promulgated, and the police
      power was invoked in some instances to justify sweeping measures, such as
      the prohibition of whisky manufacture in North Carolina and South
      Carolina. The military governors levied, increased, or decreased taxes and
      made appropriations which the state treasurers were forced to pay, but
      they restrained the radical conventions, all of which wished to spend much
      money.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">146</a></span>
			According to the Act of March 23, 1867, the generals and their
      appointees were to be paid by the United States, but in practice the
      running expenses of reconstruction were paid by the state treasurers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any attempt to favor the Confederate soldiers was frowned upon. Laws
      providing wooden legs and free education for crippled Confederates were
      suspended. Militia organizations and military schools were forbidden. No
      uniform might be worn, no parades were permitted, no memorial and
      historical societies were to be organized, and no meeting of any kind
      could be held without a permit. The attempt to control the press resulted
      in what one general called "a horrible uproar." Editors were forbidden to
      express themselves too strongly against reconstruction; public advertising
      and printing were awarded only to those papers actively supporting
      reconstruction. Several newspapers were suppressed, a notable example
      being the <i>Tuscaloosa Independent Monitor</i>, whose editor,
			Ryland Randolph, was a picturesque figure in Alabama journalism and a
			leader in the Ku Klux Klan.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military administration was thorough, and, as a whole honest and
      efficient. With fewer than ten thousand soldiers the generals maintained
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
      order and carried on the reconstruction of the South. The whites made no
      attempt at resistance, though they were irritated by military rule and
      resented the loss of self-government. But most Southerners preferred the
      rule of the army to the alternative reign of the carpetbagger, scalawag,
      and negro. The extreme radicals at the North, on the other hand, were
      disgusted at the conservative policy of the generals. The apathy of the
      whites at the beginning of the military reconstruction excited surprise on
      all sides. Not only was there no violent opposition, but for a few weeks
      there was no opposition at all. The civil officials were openly
      unsympathetic, and the newspapers voiced dissent not untouched with
      disgust; others simply could not take the situation seriously because it
      seemed so absurd; many leaders were indifferent, while others&mdash;among
			them, Generals Lee, Beauregard, and Longstreet, and Governor
	    Patton&mdash;without approving the policy, advised the whites to
			co&ouml;perate with the military authorities and save all they could out
			of the situation. General Beauregard, for instance, wrote in 1867: "If the
			suffrage of the negro is properly handled and directed we shall defeat
			our adversaries with their own weapons. The negro
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
			is Southern born. With education and property qualifications he can be
			made to take an interest in the affairs of the South and in its
			prosperity. He will side with the whites."
    </p>
    <p>
      Northern observers who were friendly to the South or who disapproved of
      this radical reconstruction saw the danger more clearly than the
      Southerners themselves, who seemed not to appreciate the full implication
      of the situation. In this connection the New York <i>Herald</i> remarked:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      We may regard the entire ten unreconstructed Southern States, with
      possibly one or two exceptions, as forced by a secret and overwhelming
      revolutionary influence to a common and inevitable fate. They are all
      bound to be governed by blacks spurred on by worse than blacks&mdash;white
      wretches who dare not show their faces in respectable society anywhere.
      This is the most abominable phase barbarism has assumed since the dawn of
      civilization. It was all right and proper to put down the rebellion. It
      was all right perhaps to emancipate the slaves.&hellip; But it is not
			right to make slaves of white men even though they may have been former
			masters of blacks. This is but a change in a system of bondage that is
			rendered the more odious and intolerable because it has been inaugurated
			in an enlightened instead of a dark and uncivilized age.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The political parties rapidly grouped themselves for the coming struggle.
      The radical Republican
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
			party indeed was in process of organization in the South even before the
			passage of the reconstruction acts. Its membership was made up of negroes,
			carpetbaggers, or Northern men who had come in as speculators, officers
			of the Freedmen's Bureau and of the army, scalawags or Confederate
			renegades, "Peace Society" men, &sup1; and Unionists of Civil War times,
			with a few old Whigs who could not yet bring themselves to affiliate with
			the Democrats. At first it seemed that a respectable number of whites
			might be secured for the radical party, but the rapid organization of the
			negroes checked the accession of whites. In the winter and spring of
			1866-67 the negroes near the towns were well organized by the Union League
			and the Freedmen's Bureau and then, after the passage of the
			reconstruction acts, the organizing activities of the radical chieftains
			shifted to the rural districts. The Union League was greatly extended;
			Union League conventions were held to which local whites were not
			admitted; and the formation of a black man's party was well on the way
      before the registration of the voters was completed. Visiting statesmen
      from the North, among them
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
			Henry Wilson of Massachusetts and "Pig Iron" Kelley of Pennsylvania,
			toured the South in support of the radical program, and the registrars
			and all Federal officials aided in the work.
    </p>

     Stephenson (in <i>The Chronicles of America</i>), p. 121,
     footnote.</p>
</div>

    <p>
      The whites, slow to comprehend the real extent of radicalism, were finally
      aroused to the necessity of organizing, if they were to influence the
      negro and have a voice in the conventions. The old party divisions were
      still evident. With difficulty a portion of the Whigs were brought with
			the Democrats into one conservative party during the summer and fall of
			1867, though many still held aloof. The lack of the old skilled leadership
			was severely felt. In places where the white man's party was given a name
			it was called "Democratic <em>and</em> Conservative," to spare the
			feelings of former Whigs who were loath to bear the party name of their
			quondam opponents.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first step in the military reconstruction was the registration of
      voters. In each State a central board of registrars was appointed by the
      district commander and a local board for every county and large town. Each
      board consisted of three members&mdash;all radicals&mdash;who were
      required to subscribe to the "ironclad" oath. In several States one negro
      was appointed to each local board. The
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
			registrars listed negro voters during the day, and at night worked at the
		  organization of a radical Republican party. The prospective voters were
			required to take the oath prescribed in the Reconstruction Act, but the
			registrars were empowered to go behind the oath and investigate the
			Confederate record of each applicant. This authority was invoked to carry
			the disfranchisement of the whites far beyond the intention of the law in
			an attempt to destroy the leadership of the whites and to register enough
			negroes to outvote them at the polls. For this purpose the registration
			was continued until October 1, 1867, and an active campaign of education
			and organization carried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the close of the registration, 703,000 black voters were on the rolls
      and 627,000 whites. In Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Florida, and
      Mississippi there were black majorities, and in the other States the
      blacks and the radical whites together formed majorities. The white
      minorities included several thousand who had been rejected by the
      registrars but restored by the military commanders. Though large numbers
      of blacks were dropped from the revised rolls as fraudulently registered,
      the registration statistics nevertheless
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
			bore clear witness to the political purpose of those who compiled them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next followed a vote on the question of holding a state convention and the
      election of delegates to such a convention if held&mdash;a double
      election. The whites, who had been harassed in the registration and who
      feared race conflicts at the elections, considered whether they ought not
      to abstain from voting. By staying away from the polls, they might bring
      the vote cast in each State below a majority and thus defeat the proposed
      conventions for, unless a majority of the registered voters actually cast
      ballots either for or against a convention, no convention could be held.
      Nowhere, however, was this plan of not voting fully carried out, for,
      though most whites abstained, enough of them voted (against the
      conventions, of course) to make the necessary majority in each State. The
      effect of the abstention policy upon the personnel of the conventions was
      unfortunate. In every convention there was a radical majority with a
      conservative and all but negligible minority. In South Carolina and
      Louisiana there were negro majorities. In every State except North
      Carolina, Texas, and Virginia the negroes and the carpetbaggers together
      were in the majority over native whites.
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
      The conservative whites were of fair ability; the carpetbaggers and
      scalawags produced in each convention a few able leaders, but most of them
      were conscienceless political soldiers of fortune; the negro members were
      inexperienced, and most of them were quite ignorant, though a few leaders
      of ability did appear among them. In Alabama, for example, only two negro
      members could write, though half had been taught to sign their names. They
      were barbers, field hands, hack drivers, and servants. A negro chaplain
      was elected who invoked divine blessings on "unioners and cusses on
      rebels." It was a sign of the new era when the convention specially
      invited the "ladies of colored members" to seats in the gallery.
    </p>
    <p>
      The work of the conventions was for the most part cut and dried, the abler
      members having reached a general agreement before they met. The
      constitutions, mosaics of those of other States, were noteworthy only for
      the provisions made to keep the whites out of power and to regulate the
      relations of the races in social matters. The Texas constitution alone
      contained no proscriptive clauses beyond those required by the Fourteenth
      Amendment. The most thoroughgoing proscription of Confederates was found
      in the constitutions
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
			of Mississippi, Alabama, and Virginia; and in these States the voter must
			also purge himself of guilt by agreeing to accept the "civil and political
			equality of all men" or by supporting reconstruction. Only in South
			Carolina and Louisiana were race lines abolished by law.
    </p>
    <p>
      The legislative work of the conventions was more interesting than the
      constitution making. By ordinance the legality of negro marriages was
      dated from November, 1867, or some date later than had been fixed by the
      white conventions of 1865. Mixed schools were provided in some States;
      militia for the black districts but not for the white was to be raised;
      while in South Carolina it was made a penal offense to call a person a
      "Yankee" or a "nigger." Few of the negro delegates demanded proscription
      of whites or social equality; they wanted schools and the vote. The white
      radicals were more anxious to keep the former Confederates from holding
      office than from voting. The generals in command everywhere used their
      influence to secure moderate action by the conventions, and for this they
      were showered with abuse.
    </p>
    <p>
      As provided by the reconstruction acts, the new constitutions were
      submitted to the electorate
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
			created by those instruments. Unless a majority of the registered voters
			in a State should take part in the election the reconstruction would fail
			and the State would remain under military rule. The whites now inaugurated
			a more systematic policy of abstention and in Alabama, on February 4,
			1868, succeeded in holding the total vote below a majority. Congress then
			rushed to the rescue of radicalism with the act of the 11th of March,
			which provided that a mere majority of those voting in the State was
			sufficient to inaugurate reconstruction. Arkansas had followed the lead of
			Alabama, but too late; in Mississippi the constitution was defeated by a
			majority vote; in Texas the convention had made no provision for a vote;
			and in Virginia the commanding general, disapproving of the work of the
			convention, refused to pay the expenses of an election. In the other six
			States the constitutions were adopted. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_06-3" name="footer_06-3"></a>
&sup1; Except in Texas, the work of constitution making was
     completed between November 5, 1867, and May 18, 1868.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      These elections gave rise to more violent contests than before. They also
      were double elections, as the voters cast ballots for state and local
      officials and at the same time for or against the constitution. The
      radical nominations were made by the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
			Union League and the Freedmen's Bureau, and nearly all radicals who had
			been members of conventions were nominated and elected to office. The
			negroes, expecting now to reap some benefits of reconstruction, frequently
			brought sacks to the polls to "put the franchise in." The elections were
			all over by June, 1868, and the newly elected legislatures promptly
			ratified the Fourteenth Amendment.
    </p>
    <p>
      It now remained for Congress to approve the work done in the South and to
      readmit the reorganized States. The case of Alabama gave some trouble.
      Even Stevens, for a time, thought that this State should stay out; but
      there was danger in delay. The success of the abstention policy in Alabama
      and Arkansas and the reviving interest of the whites foreshadowed white
      majorities in some places; the scalawags began to forsake the radical
      party for the conservatives; and there were Democratic gains in the North
      in 1867. Only six States, New York and five New England States, allowed
      the negro to vote, while four States, Minnesota, Michigan, Kansas, and
      Ohio, voted down negro suffrage after the passage of the reconstruction
      acts. The ascendancy of the radicals in Congress was menaced. The radicals
      needed the support of their radical brethren in Southern States
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
			and they could not afford to wait for the Fourteenth Amendment to become
			a part of the Constitution or to tolerate other delay. On the 22d and the
			25th of June acts were therefore passed admitting seven States, Alabama
			included, to representation in Congress upon the "fundamental condition"
			that "the constitutions of neither of said States shall ever be so amended
			or changed as to deprive any citizens or class of citizens of the United
      States of the right to vote in said State, who are entitled to vote by the
      constitution thereof herein recognized."
    </p>
    <p>
      The generals now turned over the government to the recently elected
      radical officials and retired into the background. Military reconstruction
      was thus accomplished in all the States except Virginia, Mississippi, and
      Texas.

		<p class="chaptertitle">The Trial of President Johnson</p>
		<p class="noindent"><span class="first-word">While</span>
      the radical program was being executed in the South, Congress was
      engaged not only in supervising reconstruction but in subduing the Supreme
      Court and in "conquering" President Johnson. One must admire the
      efficiency of the radical machine. When the Southerners showed that they
      preferred military rule as permitted by the Act of the 2nd of March,
      Congress passed the Act of the 23d of March which forced the
      reconstruction. When the President ventured to assert his power in behalf
      of a considerate administration of the reconstruction acts, Congress took
      the power out of his hands by the law of the 19th of July. The Southern
      plan to defeat the new state constitutions by abstention was no sooner
      made clear in the case of Alabama than Congress came to the rescue with
      the Act of March 11, 1868.
    </p>
    <p>
      Had it seemed necessary, Congress would have
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
			handled the Supreme Court as it did the Southerners. The opponents of
			radical reconstruction were anxious to get the reconstruction laws of
			March, 1867, before the Court. Chief Justice Chase was known to be
		  opposed to military reconstruction, and four other justices were, it was
			believed, doubtful of the constitutionality of the laws. A series of
			conservative decisions gave hope to those who looked to the Court for
			relief. The first decision, in the case of <i>ex parte</i> Milligan,
			declared unconstitutional the trials of civilians by military commissions
			when civil courts were open. A few months later, in the cases of Cummings
			<i>vs</i>. Missouri and <i>ex parte</i> Garland, the Court declared
			invalid, because <i>ex post facto</i>, the state laws designed to punish
			former Confederates.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the first attempts to get the reconstruction acts before the Supreme
      Court failed. The State of Mississippi, in April, 1867, brought suit to
      restrain the President from executing the reconstruction acts. The Court
      refused to interfere with the Executive. A similar suit was then brought
      against Secretary Stanton by Georgia with a like result. But in 1868, in
      the case of <i>ex parte</i> McCardle, it appeared that the question of the
      constitutionality of the reconstruction acts
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
			would be passed upon. McCardle, a Mississippi editor arrested for
			opposition to reconstruction and convicted by military commission,
			appealed to the Supreme Court, which asserted its jurisdiction. But the
			radicals in alarm rushed through Congress an act (March 27, 1868) which
			took away from the Court its jurisdiction in cases arising under the
			reconstruction acts. The highest court was thus silenced.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt to remove the President from office was the only part of the
      radical program that failed, and this by the narrowest of margins. During
      the spring and summer of 1866 there was some talk among politicians of
      impeaching President Johnson, and in December a resolution was introduced
      by Representative Ashley of Ohio looking toward impeachment. Though the
      committee charged with the investigation of "the official conduct of
      Andrew Johnson" reported that enough testimony had been taken to justify
      further inquiry, the House took no action. There were no less than five
      attempts at impeachment during the next year. Stevens, Butler, and others
      were anxious to get the President out of the way, but the majority were as
      yet unwilling to impeach for merely political reasons. There were some
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
			who thought that the radicals had sufficient majorities to ensure all
			needed legislation and did not relish the thought of Ben Wade in the
		  presidency. &sup1; Others considered that no just grounds for action had
			been found in the several investigations of Johnson's record. Besides,
		  the President's authority and influence had been much curtailed by the
			legislation relating to the Freedmen's Bureau, tenure of office,
			reconstruction, and command of the army, and Congress had also refused to
			recognize his amnesty and pardoning powers.
    </p>
		<div class="footer">

      <a id="footer_07-1" name="footer_07-1"></a>
&sup1; Senator Wade of Ohio was President <i>pro tempore</i> of the
     Senate and by the act of 1791 would succeed President
     Johnson if he were removed from office.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      But the desire to impeach the President was increasing in power, and very
      little was needed to provoke a trial of strength between the radicals and
      the President. The drift toward impeachment was due in part to the
      legislative reaction against the Executive, and in part to Johnson's own
      opposition to reconstruction and to his use of the patronage against the
      radicals. Specific grievances were found in his vetoes of the various
      reconstruction bills, in his criticisms of Congress and the radical
      leaders, and in the fact, as Stevens asserted, that he was a "radical
      renegade."
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
			Johnson was a Southern man, an old-line State Rights Democrat,
      somewhat anti-negro in feeling. He knew no book except the Constitution,
      and that he loved with all his soul. Sure of the correctness of his
      position, he was too stubborn to change or to compromise. He was no more
      to be moved than Stevens or Sumner. To overcome Johnson's vetoes required
      two-thirds of each House of Congress; to impeach and remove him would
      require only a majority of the House and two-thirds of the Senate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The desired occasion for impeachment was furnished by Johnson's attempt to
      get Edwin M. Stanton, the Secretary of War, out of the Cabinet. Stanton
      held radical views and was at no time sympathetic with or loyal to
      Johnson, but he loved office too well to resign along with those cabinet
      members who could not follow the President in his struggle with Congress.
      He was seldom frank and sincere in his dealings with the President, and
      kept up an underhand correspondence with the radical leaders, even
      assisting in framing some of the reconstruction legislation which was
      designed to render Johnson powerless. In him the radicals had a
      representative within the President's Cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
      Wearied of Stanton's disloyalty, Johnson asked him to resign and, upon a
      refusal, suspended him in August, 1867, and placed General Grant in
      temporary charge of the War Department. General Grant, Chief Justice
      Chase, and Secretary McCulloch, though they all disliked Stanton, advised
      the President against suspending him. But Johnson was determined. About
      the same time he exercised his power in removing Sheridan and Sickles from
      their commands in the South and replaced them with Hancock and Canby. The
      radicals were furious, but Johnson had secured at least the support of a
      loyal Cabinet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspension of Stanton was reported to the Senate in December, 1867,
			and on January 13, 1868, the Senate voted not to concur in the
		  President's action. Upon receiving notice of the vote in the Senate,
	    Grant at once left the War Department and Stanton again took possession.
			Johnson now charged Grant with failing to keep a promise either to hold
			on himself or to make it possible to appoint some one else who would hold
			on until the matter might be brought into the courts. The President by
			this accusation angered Grant and threw him with his great influence
			into the arms of the radicals.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
			Against the advice of his leading counselors Johnson persisted
      in his intention to keep Stanton out of the Cabinet. Accordingly on the
      21st of February he dismissed Stanton from office and appointed Lorenzo
      Thomas, the Adjutant General, as acting Secretary of War. Stanton, advised
      by the radicals in Congress to "stick," refused to yield possession to
      Thomas and had him arrested for violation of the Tenure of Office Act. The
      matter now was in the courts where Johnson wanted it, but the radical
      leaders, fearing that the courts would decide against Stanton and the
      reconstruction acts, had the charges against Thomas withdrawn. Thus failed
      the last attempt to get the reconstruction laws before the courts. On the
      22nd of February the President sent to the Senate the name of Thomas
      Ewing, General Sherman's father-in-law, as Secretary of War, but no
      attention was paid to the nomination.
    </p>
    <p>
      On February 24, 1868, the House voted, 128 to 47, to impeach the President
      "of high crimes and misdemeanors in office." The Senate was formally
      notified the next day and on the 4th of March the seven managers selected
      by the House appeared before the Senate with the eleven articles of
      impeachment. At first it seemed to the public
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
			that the impeachment proceedings were merely the culmination of a struggle
		  for the control of the army. There were rumors that Johnson had plans to
			use the army against Congress and against reconstruction. General Grant,
			directed by Johnson to accept orders from Stanton only if he were
			satisfied that they came from the President, refused to follow these
			instructions. Stanton, professing to fear violence, barricaded himself in
			the War Department and was furnished with a guard of soldiers by General
			Grant, who from this time used his influence in favor of impeachment.
			Excited by the most sensational rumors, some people even believed a new
			rebellion to be imminent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The impeachment was rushed to trial by the House managers and was not
      ended until the decision was taken by the votes of the 16th and 26th of
      May. The eleven articles of impeachment consisted of summaries of all that
      had been charged against Johnson, except the charge that he had been an
      accomplice in the murder of Lincoln. The only one which had any real basis
      was the first, which asserted that he had violated the Tenure of Office
      Act in trying to remove Stanton. The other articles were merely expansions
      of the first or
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
			were based upon Johnson's opposition to reconstruction or upon his
			speeches in criticism of Congress. Nothing could be said about his
			control of the patronage, though this was one of the unwritten charges.
			J.&nbsp;W. Schuckers, in his life of Chase, says that the radical
      leaders "felt the vast importance of the presidential patronage; many of
      them felt, too, that, according to the maxim that to the victors belong
      the spoils, the Republican party was rightfully entitled to the Federal
      patronage, and they determined to get possession of it. There was but one
      method and that was by impeachment and removal of the President."
    </p>
    <p>
      The leading House managers were Stevens, Butler, Bingham, and Boutwell,
      all better known as politicians than as lawyers. The President was
      represented by an abler legal array: Curtis, Evarts, Stanbery, Nelson,
			and Groesbeck. Jeremiah Black was at first one of the counsel for the
      President but withdrew under conditions not entirely creditable to
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trial was a one-sided affair. The President's counsel were refused
      more than six days for the preparation of the case. Chief Justice Chase,
      who presided over the trial, insisted upon regarding the Senate as a
      judicial and not a political
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
			body, and he accordingly ruled that only legal evidence should be
			admitted; but the Senate majority preferred to assume that they were
			settling a political question. Much evidence favorable to the President
			was excluded, but everything else was admitted. As the trial went on the
		  country began to understand that the impeachment was a mistake. Few
			people wanted to see Senator Wade made President. The partisan attitude
			of the Senate majority and the weakness of the case against Johnson had
			much to do in moderating public opinion, and the timely nomination of
		  General Schofield as Secretary of War after Stanton's resignation
			reassured those who feared that the army might be placed under some
			extreme Democrat.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the time drew near for the decision, every possible pressure was
      brought by the radicals to induce senators to vote for conviction. To
      convict the President, thirty-six votes were necessary. There were only
      twelve Democrats in the Senate, but all were known to be in favor of
      acquittal. When the test came on the 16th of May, seven Republicans voted
      with the Democrats for acquittal on the eleventh article. Another vote on
      the 26th of May, on the first and second articles,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
			showed that conviction was not possible. The radical legislative reaction
			was thus checked at its highest point and the presidency as a part of the
			American governmental system was no longer in danger. The seven
			Republicans had, however, signed their own political death warrants;
		  they were never forgiven by the party leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The presidential campaign was beginning to take shape even before the
      impeachment trial began. Both the Democrats and the reorganized
      Republicans were turning with longing toward General Grant as a candidate.
      Though he had always been a Democrat, nevertheless when Johnson actually
      called him a liar and a promise breaker Grant went over to the radicals
      and was nominated for President on May 20, 1868, by the National Union
      Republican party. Schuyler Colfax was the candidate for Vice President.
      The Democrats, who could have won with Grant and who under good leadership
      still had a bare chance to win, nominated Horatio Seymour of New York and
      Francis P. Blair of Missouri. The former had served as war governor of New
      York, while the latter was considered an extreme Democrat who believed
      that the radical reconstruction of the South should be stopped, the troops
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
      withdrawn, and the people left to form their own governments. The
      Democratic platform pronounced itself opposed to the reconstruction
      policy, but Blair's opposition was too extreme for the North. Seymour,
      more moderate and a skillful campaigner, made headway in the
      rehabilitation of the Democratic party. The Republican party declared for
      radical reconstruction and negro suffrage in the South but held that each
      Northern State should be allowed to settle the suffrage for itself. It was
      not a courageous platform, but Grant was popular and carried his party
      through to success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The returns showed that in the election Grant had carried twenty-six
      States with 214 electoral votes, while Seymour had carried only eight
      States with 80 votes. But an examination of the popular vote, which was
      3,000,000 for Grant and 2,700,000 for Seymour, gave the radicals cause for
      alarm, for it showed that the Democrats had more white votes than the
      Republicans, whose total included nearly 700,000 blacks. To insure the
      continuance of the radicals in power, the Fifteenth Amendment was framed
      and sent out to the States on February 26, 1869. This amendment appeared
      not only to make safe the negro
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
			majorities in the South but also gave the ballot to the negroes in a
		  score of Northern States and thus assured, for a time at least,
			900,000 negro voters for the Republican party.

</div>
    <p>
      When Johnson's term ended and he gave place to President Grant, four
      States were still unreconstructed&mdash;Virginia, Texas, and Mississippi,
      in which the reconstruction had failed, and Georgia, which, after
      accomplishing reconstruction, had again been placed under military rule by
      Congress. In Virginia, which was too near the capital for such rough work
      as readmitted Arkansas and Alabama into the Union, the new constitution
      was so severe in its provisions for disfranchisement that the disgusted
      district commander would not authorize the expenditure necessary to have
      it voted on. In Mississippi a similar constitution had failed of adoption,
      and in Texas the strife of party factions, radical and moderate
      Republican, had so delayed the framing of the constitution that it had not
      come to a vote.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Republican politicians, however, wanted the offices in these States,
      and Congress by its resolution of February 18, 1869 directed the district
      commanders to remove all civil officers who could not take the "ironclad"
      oath and to appoint
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
			those who could subscribe to it. An exception, however, was made in favor
		  of the scalawags who had supported reconstruction and whose disabilities
			had been removed by Congress.
    </p>
    <p>
      President Grant was anxious to complete the reconstruction and recommended
      to Congress that the constitutions of Virginia and Mississippi be
      re-submitted to the people with a separate vote on the disfranchising
      sections. Congress, now in harmony with the Executive, responded by
      placing the reconstruction of the three States in the hands of the
      President, but with the proviso that each State must ratify the Fifteenth
      Amendment. Grant thereupon fixed a time for voting in each State and
      directed that in Virginia and Mississippi the disfranchising clauses be
      submitted separately. As a result, the constitutions were ratified but
      proscription was voted down. The radicals secured control of Mississippi
      and Texas, but a conservative combination carried Virginia and thus came
      near keeping the State out of the Union. Finally, during the early months
      of 1870 the three States were readmitted.
    </p>
    <p>
      With respect to Georgia a peculiar condition of affairs existed. In June,
      1868, Georgia had been readmitted with the first of the reconstructed
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
      States. The state legislature at once expelled the twenty-seven negro
      members, on the ground that the recent legislation and the state
      constitution gave the negroes the right to vote but not to hold office.
      Congress, which had already admitted the Georgia representatives, refused
      to receive the senators and turned the State back to military control. In
      1869-70 Georgia was again reconstructed after a drastic purging of the
      Legislature by the military commander, the reseating of the negro members,
      and the ratification of both the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. The
      State was readmitted to representation in July, 1870, after the failure of
      a strong effort to extend for two years the carpetbag government of the
      State.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the last States to pass under the radical yoke heavier conditions
      were imposed than upon the earlier ones. Not only were they required to
      ratify the Fifteenth Amendment, but the "fundamental conditions" embraced,
      in addition to the prohibition against future change of the suffrage, a
      requirement that the negroes should never be deprived of school and
      officeholding rights.
    </p>
    <p>
      The congressional plan of reconstruction had thus been carried through by
      able leaders in the face of the opposition of a united white South,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
			nearly half the North, the President, the Supreme Court, and in the
			beginning a majority of Congress. This success was due to the poor
			leadership of the conservatives and to the ability and solidarity of
			the radicals led by Stevens and Sumner. The radicals had a definite
			program; the moderates had not. The object of the radicals was to secure
			the supremacy in the South by the aid of the negroes and exclusion of
			whites. Was this policy politically wise? It was at least temporarily
			successful. The choice offered by the radicals seemed to lie between
		  military rule for an indefinite period and negro suffrage; and since
			most Americans found military rule distasteful, they preferred to try
			negro suffrage. But, after all, negro suffrage had to be supported by
			military rule, and in the end both failed completely.

    </h2>
		<p class="chaptertitle">The Union League of America</p>
		<p class="noindent"><span class="first-word">The</span>
      elections of 1867-68 showed that the negroes were well organized under
      the control of the radical Republican leaders and that their former
      masters had none of the influence over the blacks in political matters
      which had been feared by some Northern friends of the negro and had been
      hoped for by such Southern leaders as Governor Patton and General Hampton.
      Before 1865 the discipline of slavery, the influence of the master's
      family, and of the Southern church, had sufficed to control the blacks.
			But after emancipation they looked to the Federal soldiers and Union
			officials as the givers of freedom and the guardians of the future.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the Union soldiers, especially the negro troops, from the Northern
      teachers, the missionaries and the organizers of negro churches, from the
      Northern officials and traveling politicians, the negroes learned that
      their interests were not those
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
			of the whites. The attitude of the average white in the South often
			confirmed this growing estrangement. It was difficult even for the white
			leaders to explain the riots at Memphis and New Orleans. And those who
			sincerely wished well for the negro and who desired to control him for
			the good of both races could not possibly assure him that he was fit for
			the suffrage. For even Patton and Hampton must tell him that they knew
			better than he and that he should follow their advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The appeal made to freedmen by the Northern leaders was in every way more
      forceful, because it had behind it the prestige of victory in war and for
      the future it could promise anything. Until 1867 the principal agency in
      bringing about the separation of the races had been the Freedmen's Bureau
      which, with its authority, its courts, its rations, clothes, and its
      "forty acres and a mule," did effective work in breaking down the
      influence of the master. But to understand fully the almost absolute
      control exercised over the blacks in 1867-68 by alien adventurers one
      must examine the workings of an oath-bound society known as the Union or
      Loyal League. It was this order, dominated by a few radical whites, which
      organized, disciplined, and controlled the ignorant
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
			negro masses and paralyzed the influence of the conservative whites.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Union League of America had its origin in Ohio in the fall of 1862,
      when the outlook for the Union cause was gloomy. The moderate policies of
      the Lincoln Administration had alienated those in favor of extreme
      measures; the Confederates had won military successes in the field; the
      Democrats had made some gains in the elections; the Copperheads &sup1;
			were actively opposed to the Washington Government; the Knights of the
			Golden Circle were organizing to resist the continuance of the war; and
			the Emancipation Proclamation had chilled the loyalty of many Union men,
		  which was everywhere at a low ebb, especially in the Northern cities. It
		  was to counteract these depressing influences that the Union League
		  movement was begun among those who were associated in the work of the
		  United States Sanitary Commission. Observing the threatening state of
		  public opinion, members of this organization proposed that "loyalty be
		  organized, consolidated and made effective."

			League followed. The members were pledged to uncompromising and
			unconditional loyalty to the Union, to complete subordination of
			political views to this loyalty, and to the repudiation of any belief
			in state rights. The other large cities followed the example of
			Philadelphia and New York, and soon Leagues, connected in a loose
			federation, were formed all through the North. They were social as
      well as political in their character and assumed as their task the
      stimulation and direction of loyal Union opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the Union armies proceeded to occupy the South, the Union League sent
      its agents among the disaffected Southern people. Its agents cared for
      negro refugees in the contraband camps and in the North. In such work the
      League co&ouml;perated with the various Freedmen's Aid Societies, the
      Department of Negro Affairs, and later with the Freedmen's Bureau. Part of
      the work of the League was to distribute campaign literature, and many of
      the radical pamphlets on reconstruction and the negro problem bore the
      Union League imprint. The New York League sent out about seventy
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
			thousand copies of various publications, while the Philadelphia League far
      surpassed this record, circulating within eight years four million five
      hundred thousand copies of 144 different pamphlets. The literature
      consisted largely of accounts of "Southern outrages" taken from the
      reports of Bureau agents and similar sources.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the close of the Civil War the League did not cease its active
      interest in things political. It was one of the first organizations to
      declare for negro suffrage and the disfranchisement of Confederates; it
      held steadily to this declaration during the four years following the war;
      and it continued as a sort of bureau in the radical Republican party for
      the purpose of controlling the negro vote in the South. Its
      representatives were found in the lobbies of Congress demanding extreme
      measures, endorsing the reconstruction policies of Congress, and
      condemning the course of the President. After the first year or two of
      reconstruction the Leagues in the larger Northern cities began to grow
      away from the strictly political Union League of America and tended to
      become mere social clubs for members of the same political belief. The
      eminently respectable Philadelphia and New York clubs had little in common
      with
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
			the leagues of the Southern and Border States except a general
      adherence to the radical program.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even before the end of the war the League was extending its organization
      into the parts of the Confederacy held by the Federal forces, admitting to
      membership the army officers and the leading Unionists, though maintaining
      for the sake of the latter "a discreet secrecy." With the close of the war
      and the establishment of army posts over the South the League grew
      rapidly. The civilians who followed the army, the Bureau agents, the
      missionaries, and the Northern teachers formed one class of membership;
      and the loyalists of the hill and mountain country, who had become
      disaffected toward the Confederate administration and had formed such
      orders as the Heroes of America, the Red String Band, and the Peace
      Society, formed another class. Soon there were added to these the
      deserters, a few old line Whigs who intensely disliked the Democrats, and
      others who decided to cast their lot with the victors. The disaffected
      politicians of the up-country, who wanted to be cared for in the
      reconstruction, saw in the organization a means of dislodging from power
      the political leaders of the low country. It has been estimated that
      thirty per cent of the white men of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
			the hill and mountain counties of the South joined the Union League in
			1865-66. They cared little about the original objects of the order but
			hoped to make it the nucleus of an anti-Democratic political organization.
    </p>
    <p>
      But on the admission of negroes into the lodges or councils controlled by
      Northern men the native white members began to withdraw. From the
      beginning the Bureau agents, the teachers, and the preachers had been
      holding meetings of negroes, to whom they gave advice about the problems
      of freedom. Very early these advisers of the blacks grasped the
      possibilities inherent in their control of the schools, the rationing
      system, and the churches. By the spring of 1866 the negroes were widely
      organized under this leadership, and it needed but slight change to
      convert the negro meetings into local councils of the Union League. &sup1;
			As soon as it seemed likely that Congress would win in its struggle with
			the President the guardians of the negro planned their campaign for the
      control
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
			of the race. Negro leaders were organized into councils of the
      League or into Union Republican Clubs. Over the South went the organizers,
      until by 1868 the last negroes were gathered into the fold.
    </p>

		  <p>
      <a id="footer_08-2" name="footer_08-2"></a>
&sup1; Of these teachers of the local blacks, E.&nbsp;L. Godkin,
     editor of the New York <i>Nation,</i> who had supported the
     reconstruction acts, said: "Worse instructors for men
     emerging from slavery and coming for the first time face to
     face with the problems of free life than the radical
     agitators who have undertaken the political guidance of the
     blacks it would be hard to meet with."</p>
</div>
    <p>
      The native whites did not all desert the Union League when the negroes
      were brought in. Where the blacks were most numerous the desertion of
      whites was general, but in the regions where they were few some of the
      whites remained for several years. The elections of 1868 showed a falling
      off of the white radical vote from that of 1867, one measure of the extent
      of loss of whites. From this time forward the order consisted mainly of
      blacks with enough whites for leaders. In the Black Belt the membership of
      native whites was discouraged by requiring an oath to the effect that
      secession was treason. The carpetbagger had found that he could control
      the negro without the help of the scalawag. The League organization was
      soon extended and centralized; in every black district there was a
      Council; for the State there was a Grand Council; and for the United
      States there was a National Grand Council with headquarters in New York
      City.
    </p>
    <p>
      The influence of the League over the negro was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
			due in large degree to the mysterious secrecy of the meetings, the weird
			initiation ceremony that made him feel fearfully good from his head to his
			heels, the imposing ritual, and the songs. The ritual, it is said, was not
			used in the North; it was probably adopted for the particular benefit of
			the African. The would-be Leaguer was informed that the emblems of the
			order were the altar, the Bible, the Declaration of Independence, the
			Constitution of the United States, the flag of the Union, censer, sword,
			gavel, ballot box, sickle, shuttle, anvil, and other emblems of industry.
			He was told to the accompaniment of clanking chains and groans that the
			objects of the order were to preserve liberty, to perpetuate the Union,
			to maintain the laws and the Constitution, to secure the ascendancy of
			American institutions, to protect, defend, and strengthen all loyal men
			and members of the Union League in all rights of person and property, to
			demand the elevation of labor, to aid in the education of laboring men,
			and to teach the duties of American citizenship. This enumeration of the
			objects of the League sounded well and was impressive. At this point the
			negro was always willing to take an oath of secrecy, after which he was
			asked to swear with a solemn oath to support the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
			principles of the Declaration of Independence, to pledge himself to resist
			all attempts to overthrow the United States, to strive for the maintenance
			of liberty, the elevation of labor, the education of all people in the
			duties of citizenship, to practice friendship and charity to all of the
		  order, and to support for election or appointment to office only such men
			as were supporters of these principles and measures.
    </p>
    <p>
      The council then sang <i>Hail, Columbia!</i> and <i>The Star Spangled
			Banner</i>, after which an official lectured the candidates, saying that
			though the designs of traitors had been thwarted, there were yet to be
			secured legislative triumphs and the complete ascendancy of the true
			principles of popular government, equal liberty, education and elevation
			of the workmen, and the overthrow at the ballot box of the old oligarchy
			of political leaders. After prayer by the chaplain, the room was darkened,
			alcohol on salt flared up with a ghastly light as the "fire of liberty,"
			and the members joined hands in a circle around the candidate, who was
			made to place one hand on the flag and, with the other raised, swear
			again to support the government and to elect true Union men to office.
			Then placing his hand on a Bible, for the third time he
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
			swore to keep his oath, and repeated after the president "the Freedmen's
			Pledge": "To defend and perpetuate freedom and the Union, I pledge my
			life, my fortune, and my sacred honor. So help me God!" <i>John Brown's
			Body</i> was then sung, the president charged the members in a long
			speech concerning the principles of the order, and the marshal instructed
			the neophyte in the signs. To pass one's self as a Leaguer, the "Four
			L's" had to be given: (1) with right hand raised to heaven, thumb and
			third finger touching ends over palm, pronounce "Liberty"; (2) bring the
			hand down over the shoulder and say "Lincoln"; (3) drop the hand open at
			the side and say "Loyal"; (4) catch the thumb in the vest or in the
			waistband and pronounce "League." This ceremony of initiation proved a
			most effective means of impressing and controlling the negro through his
			love and fear of secret, mysterious, and midnight mummery. An oath taken
			in daylight might be forgotten before the next day; not so an oath taken
			in the dead of night under such impressive circumstances. After passing
			through the ordeal, the negro usually remained faithful.
    </p>
    <p>
      In each populous precinct there was at least one council of the League,
      and always one for blacks.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
			In each town or city there were two councils, one for the whites, and
			another, with white officers, for the blacks. The council met once a week,
			sometimes oftener, nearly always at night, and in a negro church or
			schoolhouse. Guards, armed with rifles and shotguns, were stationed about
			the place of meeting in order to keep away intruders. Members of some
			councils made it a practice to attend the meetings armed as if for battle.
			In these meetings the negroes listened to inflammatory speeches by the
			would-be statesmen of the new r&eacute;gime; here they were drilled in a
			passionate conviction that their interests and those of the Southern
			whites were eternally at war.
    </p>
    <p>
      White men who joined the order before the negroes were admitted and who
      left when the latter became members asserted that the negroes were taught
      in these meetings that the only way to have peace and plenty, to get "the
      forty acres and a mule," was to kill some of the leading whites in each
      community as a warning to others. In North Carolina twenty-eight barns
      were burned in one county by negroes who believed that Governor Holden,
      the head of the State League, had ordered it. The council in Tuscumbia,
      Alabama, received advice from Memphis to use the torch
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
			because the blacks were at war with the white race. The advice was taken.
		  Three men went in front of the council as an advance guard, three followed
			with coal oil and fire, and others guarded the rear. The plan was to burn
		  the whole town, but first one negro and then another insisted on having
			some white man's house spared because "he is a good man." In the end no
			residences were burned, and a happy compromise was effected by burning
			the Female Academy. Three of the leaders were afterwards lynched.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general belief of the whites was that the ultimate object of the order
      was to secure political power and thus bring about on a large scale the
      confiscation of the property of Confederates, and meanwhile to appropriate
      and destroy the property of their political opponents wherever possible.
      Chicken houses, pigpens, vegetable gardens, and orchards were visited by
      members returning from the midnight conclaves. During the presidential
      campaign of 1868 the North Carolina League sent out circular instructions
      to the blacks advising them to drill regularly and to join the militia,
      for if Grant were not elected the negroes would go back to slavery; if he
      were elected, the negroes were to have farms, mules, and offices.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
      As soon as possible after the war the negroes had supplied themselves with
      guns and dogs as badges of freedom. They carried their guns to the League
      meetings, often marching in military formation, went through the drill
      there, marched home again along the roads, shouting, firing, and indulging
      in boasts and threats against persons whom they disliked. Later, military
      parades in the daytime were much favored. Several hundred negroes would
      march up and down the streets, abusing whites, and shoving them off the
      sidewalk or out of the road. But on the whole, there was very little
      actual violence, though the whites were much alarmed at times. That
      outrages were comparatively few was due, not to any sensible teachings of
      the leaders, but to the fundamental good nature of the blacks, who were
      generally content with mere impudence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The relations between the races, indeed, continued on the whole to be
      friendly until 1867-68. For a while, in some localities before the advent
      of the League, and in others where the Bureau was conducted by native
      magistrates, the negroes looked to their old masters for guidance and
      advice; and the latter, for the good of both races, were most eager to
      retain a moral control over the blacks.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
			They arranged barbecues and
      picnics for the negroes, made speeches, gave good advice, and believed
      that everything promised well. Sometimes the negroes themselves arranged
      the festival and invited prominent whites, for whom a separate table
      attended by negro waiters was reserved; and after dinner there followed
      speeches by both whites and blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the organization of the League, the negroes grew more reserved, and
      finally became openly unfriendly to the whites. The League alone, however,
      was not responsible for this change. The League and the Bureau had to some
      extent the same personnel, and it is frequently impossible to distinguish
      clearly between the influence of the two. In many ways the League was
      simply the political side of the Bureau. The preaching and teaching
      missionaries were also at work. And apart from the organized influences at
      work, the poor whites never laid aside their hostility towards the blacks,
      bond or free.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the campaigns grew exciting, the discipline of the order was used to
      prevent the negroes from attending Democratic meetings and hearing
      Democratic speakers. The leaders even went farther and forbade the
      attendance of the blacks
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
			at political meetings where the speakers were not endorsed by the League.
			Almost invariably the scalawag disliked the Leaguer, black or white, and
			as a political teacher often found himself proscribed by the League. At a
			Republican mass meeting in Alabama a white Republican who wanted to make
			a speech was shouted down by the negroes because he was "opposed to the
			Loyal League." He then went to another place to speak but was followed by
			the crowd, which refused to allow him to say anything. All Republicans in
			good standing had to join the League and swear that secession was
			treason&mdash;a rather stiff dose for the scalawag. Judge (later Governor)
			David P. Lewis, of Alabama, was a member for a short while but he soon
			became disgusted and published a denunciation of the order. Albion W.
			Tourg&eacute;e, the author, a radical judge, was the first chief of the
			League in North Carolina and was succeeded by Governor Holden. In Alabama,
			Generals Swayne, Spencer, and Warner, all candidates for the United
			States Senate, hastened to join the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as a candidate was nominated by the League, it was the duty of
      every member to support him actively. Failure to do so resulted in a fine
      or other more severe punishment, and members
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
			who had been expelled were still considered under the control of the
			officials. The League was, in fact, the machine of the radical party,
			and all candidates had to be governed by its edicts. As the Montgomery
			Council declared, the Union League was "the right arm of the
			Union-Republican party in the United States."
    </p>
    <p>
      Every negro was <i>ex colore</i> a member or under the control of the
			League. In the opinion of the League, white Democrats were bad enough,
			but black Democrats were not to be tolerated. It was almost necessary,
			as a measure of personal safety, for each black to support the radical
			program. It was possible in some cases for a negro to refrain from
		  taking an active part in political affairs. He might even fail to vote.
			But it was actually dangerous for a black to be a Democrat; that is,
			to try to follow his old master in politics. The whites in many cases
			were forced to advise their few faithful black friends to vote the
			radical ticket in order to escape mistreatment. Those who showed
			Democratic leanings were proscribed in negro society and expelled
			from negro churches; the negro women would not "proshay" (appreciate)
			a black Democrat. Such a one was sure to find that influence was being
			brought to bear upon
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
			his dusky sweetheart or his wife
      to cause him to see the error of his ways, and persistent adherence to the
      white party would result in his losing her. The women were converted to
      radicalism before the men, and they almost invariably used their influence
      strongly in behalf of the League. If moral suasion failed to cause the
      delinquent to see the light, other methods were used. Threats were common
      and usually sufficed. Fines were levied by the League on recalcitrant
      members. In case of the more stubborn, a sound beating was effective to
      bring about a change of heart. The offending party was "bucked and
      gagged," or he was tied by the thumbs and thrashed. Usually the sufferer
      was too afraid to complain of the way he was treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some of the methods of the Loyal League were similar to those of the later
      Ku Klux Klan. Anonymous warnings were sent to obnoxious individuals,
      houses were burned, notices were posted at night in public places and on
      the houses of persons who had incurred the hostility of the order. In
      order to destroy the influence of the whites where kindly relations still
      existed, an "exodus order" issued through the League directed all members
      to leave their old homes and obtain work elsewhere. Some of the blacks
      were loath to comply with this order,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
			but to remonstrances from the whites the usual reply was: "De word done
			sent to de League. We got to go." For special meetings the negroes were
			in some regions called together by signal guns. In this way the call
			for a gathering went out over a county in a few minutes and a few hours
			later nearly all the members in the county assembled at the appointed
			place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Negroes as organizing agents were inclined to go to extremes and for that
      reason were not so much used. In Bullock County, Alabama, a council of the
      League was organized under the direction of a negro emissary, who
      proceeded to assume the government of the community. A list of crimes and
      punishments was adopted, a court with various officials was established,
      and during the night the negroes who opposed the new r&eacute;gime were
			arrested. But the black sheriff and his deputy were in turn arrested by
			the civil authorities. The negroes then organized for resistance, flocked
			into the county seat, and threatened to exterminate the whites and take
			possession of the county. Their agents visited the plantations and forced
			the laborers to join them by showing orders purporting to be from General
      Swayne, the commander in the State, giving them the authority to kill all
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
      who resisted them. Swayne, however, sent out detachments of troops and
      arrested fifteen of the ringleaders, and the League government collapsed.
    </p>
    <p>
      After it was seen that existing political institutions were to be
      overturned in the process of reconstruction, the white councils of the
      League and, to a certain extent, the negro councils were converted into
      training schools for the leaders of the new party soon to be formed in the
      State by act of Congress. The few whites who were in control were
      unwilling to admit more white members to share in the division of the
			spoils; terms of admission became more stringent, and, especially after
			the passage of the reconstruction acts in March, 1867, many white
			applicants were rejected. The alien element from the North was in control
			and as a result, where the blacks were numerous, the largest plums fell
			to the carpetbaggers. The negro leaders&mdash;the politicians, preachers,
			and teachers&mdash;trained in the League acted as subordinates to the
			whites and were sent out to drum up the country negroes when elections
			drew near. The negroes were given minor positions when offices were more
			plentiful than carpetbaggers. Later, after some complaint, a larger share
			of the offices fell to them.
		</p>
		<p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
			The League counted its largest white membership in 1865-66, and after that
			date it steadily decreased. The largest negro membership was recorded in
			1867 and 1868. The total membership was never made known. In North
			Carolina the order claimed from seventy-five thousand to one hundred and
			twenty-five thousand members; in States with larger negro populations the
			membership was probably quite as large. After the election of 1868 only
			the councils in the towns remained active, many of them transformed into
			political clubs, loosely organized under local political leaders. The
			plantation negro needed less looking after, and except in the largest
			towns he became a kind of visiting member of the council in the town.
			The League as a political organization gradually died out by 1870. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">

      <a id="footer_08-3" name="footer_08-3"></a>
&sup1; The Ku Klux Klan had much to do with the decline of the
     organization. The League as the ally and successor of the
     Freedmen's Bureau was one of the causes of the Ku Klux
     movement, because it helped to create the conditions which
     made such a movement inevitable. As early as 1870 the
     radical leaders missed the support formerly given by the
     League, and an urgent appeal was sent out all over the South
     from headquarters in New York advocating its re&euml;stablishment
     to assist in carrying the elections of 1870.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      The League had served its purpose. It had enabled a few outsiders to
      control the negro by separating the races politically and it had compelled
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
      the negroes to vote as radicals for several years, when without its
      influence they would either not have voted at all or would have voted as
      Democrats along with their former masters. The order was necessary to the
      existence of the radical party in the Black Belt. No ordinary political
      organization could have welded the blacks into a solid party. The
      Freedmen's Bureau, which had much influence over the negroes, was too weak
      in numbers to control the negroes in politics. The League finally absorbed
      the personnel of the Bureau and turned its prestige and its organization
      to political advantage.

		<p class="chaptertitle">Church and School</p>
		<p class="noindent"><span class="first-word">Reconstruction</span>
      in the State was closely related to reconstruction in the
      churches and the schools. Here also were to be found the same hostile
      elements: negro and white, Unionist and Confederate, victor and
      vanquished. The church was at that time an important institution in the
      South, more so than in the North, and in both sections more important than
      it is today. It was inevitable, therefore, that ecclesiastical
      reconstruction should give rise to bitter feelings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something should be said of conditions in the churches when the Federal
      armies occupied the land. The Southern organizations had lost many
      ministers and many of their members, and frequently their buildings were
      used as hospitals or had been destroyed. Their administration was
      disorganized and their treasuries were empty. The Unionists, scattered
      here and there but numerous
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
			in the mountain districts, no longer wished to attend the Southern
			churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military censorship in church matters, which continued for a year in
      some districts, was irritating, especially in the Border States and in the
      Union districts where Northern preachers installed by the army were
      endeavoring to remain against the will of the people. Mobs sometimes drove
      them out; others were left to preach to empty houses or to a few Unionists
      and officers, while the congregation withdrew to build a new church. The
      problems of negro membership in the white churches and of the future
      relations of the Northern and Southern denominations were pressing for
      settlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      All Northern organizations acted in 1865 upon the assumption that a
      reunion of the churches must take place and that the divisions existing
      before the war should not be continued, since slavery, the cause of the
      division, had been destroyed. But they insisted that the reunion must take
      place upon terms named by the "loyal" churches, that the negroes must also
      come under "loyal" religious direction, and that tests must be applied to
      the Confederate sinners asking for admission, in order that the enormity
      of their
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
			crimes should be made plain to them. But this policy did not succeed. The
			Confederates objected to being treated as "rebels and traitors" and to
			"sitting upon stools of repentance" before they should be received again
			into the fold.
    </p>
    <p>
      Only two denominations were reunited&mdash;the Methodist Protestant, the
      northern section of which came over to the southern, and the Protestant
      Episcopal, in which moderate counsels prevailed and into which Southerners
      were welcomed back. The Southern Baptists maintained their separate
      existence and reorganized the Southern Baptist Convention, to which came
      many of the Baptist associations in the Border States; the Catholics did
      not divide before 1861 and therefore had no reconstruction problems to
      solve; and the smaller denominations maintained the organizations which
      they had before 1861. A Unionist preacher testified before the Joint
      Committee on Reconstruction that even the Southern Quakers "are about as
      decided in regard to the respectability of secession as any other class of
      people."
    </p>
    <p>
      Two other great Southern churches, the Presbyterian and the Methodist
      Episcopal, grew stronger after the Civil War. The tendency toward reunion
      of the Presbyterians was checked
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
			when one Northern branch declared as "a condition precedent to the
			admission of southern applicants that these confess as sinful all opinions
			before held in regard to slavery, nullification, rebellion and slavery,
			and stigmatize secession as a crime and the withdrawal of the southern
			churches as a schism." Another Northern group declared that Southern
			ministers must be placed on probation and must either prove their loyalty
			or profess repentance for disloyalty and repudiate their former opinions.
			As a result several Presbyterian bodies in the South joined in a strong
			union, to which also adhered the synods of several Border States.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Methodist Episcopal Church, South, was confronted with conditions
      similar to those which prevented the reunion of the Presbyterians. The
      Northern church, according to the declaration of its authorities, also
      came down to divide the spoils and to "disintegrate and absorb" the
      "schismatic" Southern churches. Already many Southern pulpits were filled
      with Northern Methodist ministers placed there under military protection;
      and when they finally realized that reunion was not possible, these
      Methodist worthies resolved to occupy the late Confederacy as a mission
      field and to organize congregations of blacks and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
			whites who were "not tainted with treason." Bishops and clergymen charged
			with this work carried it on vigorously for a few years in close
			connection with political reconstruction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The activities of the Northern Methodists stimulated the Southern
      Methodists to a quick reorganization. The surviving bishops met in August,
      1865, and bound together their shaken church. In reply to suggestions of
      reunion they asserted that the Northern Methodists had become "incurably
      radical," were too much involved in politics, and, further, that they had,
      without right, seized and were still holding Southern church buildings.
      They objected also to the way the Northern church referred to the
      Southerners as "schismatics" and to the Southern church as one built on
      slavery and therefore, now that slavery was gone, to be reconstructed. The
      bishops warned their people against the missionary efforts of the Northern
      brethren and against the attempts to "disintegrate and absorb" Methodism
      in the South. Within five years after the war the Methodist Episcopal
      Church, South, was greatly increased in numbers by the accession of
      conferences in Maryland, Kentucky, Virginia, Missouri, and even from above
      the Ohio, while the Northern
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
			Methodist Church was able to organize only a few white congregations
			outside of the stronger Unionist districts, but continued to labor in
			the South as a missionary field. &sup1;
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_09-1" name="footer_09-1"></a>
&sup1; The church situation after the war was well described in
     1866 by an editorial writer in the <i>Nation</i> who pointed out
     that the Northern churches thought the South determined to
     make the religious division permanent, though "slavery no
     longer furnishes a pretext for separation." "Too much pains
     were taken to bring about an ecclesiastical reunion, and
     irritating offers of reconciliation are made by the Northern
     churches, all based on the assumption that the South has not
     only sinned, but sinned knowingly, in slavery and in war. We
     expect them to be penitent and to gladly accept our offers
     of forgiveness. But the Southern people look upon a 'loyal'
     missionary as a political emissary, and 'loyal' men do not
     at present possess the necessary qualifications for
     evangelizing the Southerners or softening their hearts, and
     are sure not to succeed in doing so. We look upon their
     defeat as retribution and expect them to do the same. It
     will do no good if we tell the Southerner that 'we will
     forgive them if they will confess that they are criminals,
     offer to pray with them, preach with them, and labor with
     them over their hideous sins.'"</p>
</div>
    <p>
      But if the large Southern churches held their white membership and even
      gained in numbers and territory, they fought a losing fight to retain
      their black members. It was assumed by Northern ecclesiastics that whether
      a reunion of whites took place or not, the negroes would receive spiritual
      guidance from the North. This was necessary, they said, because the
      Southern whites were ignorant and impoverished and because "the state of
      mind among even the best classes of Southern
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
			whites rendered them incapable &hellip; of doing justice to the people
			whom they had so long persistently wronged." Further, it was also
			necessary for political reasons to remove the negroes from Southern
			religious control.
    </p>
    <p>
      For obvious reasons, however, the Southern churches wanted to hold their
      negro members. They declared themselves in favor of negro education and of
      better organized religious work among the blacks, and made every sort of
      accommodation to hold them. The Baptists organized separate congregations,
      with white or black pastors as desired, and associations of black
      churches. In 1866 the Methodist General Conference authorized separate
      congregations, quarterly conferences, annual conferences, even a separate
      jurisdiction, with negro preachers, presiding elders, and bishops&mdash;but
      all to no avail. Every Northern political, religious, or military agency
      in the South worked for separation, and negro preachers were not long in
      seeing the greater advantages which they would have in independent
      churches.
    </p>
    <p>
      Much of the separate organization was accomplished in mutual good will,
      particularly in the Baptist ranks. The Reverend I.&nbsp;T. Tichenor, a
      prominent Baptist minister, has described the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
			process as it took place in the First Baptist Church in Montgomery. The
			church had nine hundred members, of whom six hundred were black. The
			negroes received a regular organization of their own under the supervision
			of the white pastors. When a separation of the two bodies was later deemed
			desirable, it was inaugurated by a conference of the negroes which passed
			a resolution couched in the kindliest terms, suggesting the wisdom of the
			division, and asking the concurrence of the white church in such action.
			The white church cordially approved the movement, and the two bodies
			united in erecting a suitable house of worship for the negroes. Until the
			new church was completed, both congregations continued to occupy jointly
			the old house of worship. The new house was paid for in large measure by
			the white members of the church and by individuals in the community. As
			soon as it was completed the colored church moved into it with its
			pastor, board of deacons, committees of all sorts, and the whole machinery
			of church life went into action without a jar. Similar accommodations
			occurred in all the States of the South.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Methodists lost the greater part of their negro membership to two
      organizations which
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
			came down from the North in 1865&mdash;the African Methodist Episcopal
			Church and the African Methodist Episcopal Church, Zion. Large numbers
			also went over to the Northern Methodist Church. After losing nearly
			three hundred thousand members, the Southern Methodists came to the
			conclusion that the remaining seventy-eight thousand negroes would be
			more comfortable in a separate organization and therefore began in 1866
      the Colored Methodist Episcopal Church, with bishops, conferences, and all
      the accompaniments of the parent Methodist Church, which continued to give
      friendly aid but exercised no control. For many years the Colored
      Methodist Church was under fire from the other negro denominations, who
      called it the "rebel," the "Democratic," the "old slavery" church.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negro members of the Cumberland Presbyterians were similarly set off
      into a small African organization. The Southern Presbyterians and the
      Episcopalians established separate congregations and missions under white
      supervision but sanctioned no independent negro organization. Consequently
      the negroes soon deserted these churches and went with their own kind.
    </p>
    <p>
      Resentment at the methods employed by the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
			Northern religious carpetbaggers was strong among the Southern whites.
			"Emissaries of Christ and the radical party" they were called by one
			Alabama leader. Governor Lindsay of the same State asserted that the
			Northern missionaries caused race hatred by teaching the negroes to
	    regard the whites as their natural enemies, who, if possible, would put
			them back in slavery. Others were charged with teaching that to be on the
			safe side, the blacks should get into a Northern church, and that "Christ
			died for negroes and Yankees, not for rebels."
    </p>
    <p>
      The scalawags, also, developed a dislike of the Northern church work among
      the negroes and it was impossible to organize mixed congregations. Of the
      Reverend A.&nbsp;S. Lakin, a well-known agent of the Northern Methodist
			Church in Alabama, Nicholas Davis, a North Alabama Unionist and scalawag,
		  said to the Ku Klux Committee: "The character of his [Lakin's] speech was
			this: to teach the negroes that every man that was born and raised in the
		  Southern country was their enemy, that there was no use trusting them, no
			matter what they said&mdash;if they said they were for the Union or
		  anything else. 'No use talking, they are your enemies.' And he made a
			pretty good speech,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
			too; awful; a hell of a one; &hellip; inflammatory and game, too.&hellip;
			It was enough to provoke the devil. Did all the mischief he could &hellip;
			I tell you, that old fellow is a hell of an old rascal."
    </p>
    <p>
      For a time the white churches were annoyed by intrusions of strange blacks
      set on by those who were bent on separating the races. Frequently there
      were feuds in white or black congregations over the question of joining
      some Northern body. Disputes over church property also arose and continued
      for years. Lakin, referred to above, was charged with "stealing" negro
      congregations and uniting them with the Cincinnati Conference without
      their knowledge. The negroes were urged to demand title to all buildings
      formerly used for negro worship, and the Constitutional Convention of
      Alabama in 1867 directed that such property must be turned over to them
      when claimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The agents of the Northern churches were not greatly different from other
      carpetbaggers and adventurers taking advantage of the general confusion to
      seize a little power. Many were unscrupulous; others, sincere and honest
      but narrow, bigoted, and intolerant, filled with distrust of the Southern
      whites and with corresponding confidence in the blacks and in themselves.
      The
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
			missionary and church publications were quite as severe on the
      Southern people as any radical Congressman. The publications of the
      Freedmen's Aid Society furnish illustrations of the feelings and views of
      those engaged in the Southern work. They in turn were made to feel the
      effects of a merciless social proscription. For this some of them cared
      not at all, while others or their families felt it keenly. One woman
      missionary wrote that she was delighted when a Southern white would speak
      to her. A preacher in Virginia declared that "the females, those
      especially whose pride has been humbled, are more intense in their
      bitterness and endeavor to keep up a social ostracism against Union and
      Northern people." The Ku Klux raids were directed against preachers and
      congregations whose conduct was disagreeable to the whites. Lakin asserted
      that while he was conducting a great revival meeting among the hills of
      northern Alabama, Governor Smith and other prominent and sinful scalawag
      politicians were there "under conviction" and about to become converted.
      But in came the Klan and the congregation scattered. Smith and the others
			were so angry and frightened that their good feelings were dissipated, and
			the devil re&euml;ntered them, so that Lakin said he was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
      never able to "get a hold on them" again. For the souls lost that night he
      held the Klan responsible. Lakin told several marvelous stories of his
      hairbreadth escapes from death by assassination which, if true, would be
      enough to ruin the reputation of northern Alabama men for marksmanship.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reconstruction ended with conditions in the churches similar to those
      in politics: the races were separated and unfriendly; Northern and
      Southern church organizations were divided; and between them, especially
      in the border and mountain districts, there existed factional quarrels of
      a political origin, for every Northern Methodist was a Republican and
      every Southern Methodist was a Democrat.
    </p>
		<hr class="break" />
    <p>
      The schools of the South, like the churches and political institutions,
      were thrown into the melting pot of reconstruction. The spirit in which
      the work was begun may be judged from the tone of the addresses made at a
      meeting of the National Teachers Association in 1865. The president, S. S.
      Greene, declared that "the old slave States are to be the new missionary
      ground for the national school teacher." Francis Wayland, the former
      president of Brown University, remarked
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
			that "it has been a war of education and patriotism against ignorance and
		  barbarism." President Hill of Harvard spoke of the "new work of spreading
			knowledge and intellectual culture over the regions that sat in darkness."
			Other speakers asserted that the leading Southern whites were as much
			opposed to free schools as to free governments and "we must treat them as
			western farmers do the stumps in their clearings, work around them and let
			them rot out"; that the majority of the whites were more ignorant than the
			slaves; and that the negro must be educated and strengthened against "the
			wiles, the guile, and hate of his baffled masters and their minions." The
			New England Freedmen's Aid Society considered it necessary to educate the
			negro "as a counteracting influence against the evil councils and designs
			of the white freemen."
    </p>
    <p>
      The tasks that confronted the Southern States in 1865-67 were two: first,
      to restore the shattered school systems of the whites; and second, to
      arrange for the education of the negroes. Education of the negro slave had
      been looked upon as dangerous and had been generally forbidden. A small
      number of negroes could read and write, but there were at the close of the
      war no schools
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
			for the children. Before 1861 each State had developed at least the
			outlines of a school system. Though hindered in development by the
			sparseness of the population and by the prevalence in some districts
			of the Virginia doctrine that free schools were only for the poor, public
      schools were nevertheless in existence in 1861. Academies and colleges,
      however, were thronged with students. When the war ended, the public
      schools were disorganized, and the private academies and the colleges were
      closed. Teachers and students had been dispersed; buildings had been
      burned or used for hospitals and laboratories; and public libraries had
      virtually disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The colleges made efforts to open in the fall of 1865. Only one student
      presented himself at the University of Alabama for matriculation; but
      before June, 1866, the stronger colleges were again in operation. The
      public or semi-public schools for the whites also opened in the fall. In
      the cities where Federal military authorities had brought about the
      employment of Northern teachers, there was some friction. In New Orleans,
      for example, the teachers required the children to sing Northern songs and
      patriotic airs. When the Confederates were restored to power these
      teachers were dismissed.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
      The movement toward negro education was general throughout the South.
      Among the blacks themselves there was an intense desire to learn. They
      wished to read the Bible, to be preachers, to be as the old master and not
      have to work. Day and night and Sunday they crowded the schools. According
      to an observer, &sup1; "not only are individuals seen at study, and under
			the most untoward circumstances, but in very many places I have found
			what I will call 'native schools,' often rude and very imperfect, but
			there they are, a group, perhaps, of all ages, trying to learn. Some young
			man, some woman, or old preacher, in cellar, or shed, or corner of a negro
      meeting-house, with the alphabet in hand, or a town spelling-book, is
      their teacher. All are full of enthusiasm with the new knowledge the book
      is imparting to them."

</div>

    <p>
      Not only did the negroes want schooling, but both the North and the South
      proposed to give it to them. Neither side was actuated entirely by
      altruistic motives. A Hampton Institute teacher in later days remarked:
      "When the combat was over and the Yankee school-ma'ams followed in the
      train of the northern armies, the business of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
			educating the negroes was a continuation of hostilities against the
			vanquished and was so regarded to a considerable extent on both sides."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Southern churches, through their bishops and clergy, the newspapers,
      and prominent individuals such as J.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;M. Curry, John B.
			Gordon, J.&nbsp;L. Orr, Governors Brown, Moore, and Patton, came out in
			favor of negro education. Of this movement General Swayne said: "Quite
			early &hellip; the several religious denominations took strong ground in
			favor of the education of the freedmen. The principal argument was an
			appeal to sectional and sectarian prejudice, lest, the work being
			inevitable, the influence which must come from it be realized by others;
			but it is believed that this was but the shield and weapon which men of
			unselfish principle found necessary at first." The newspapers took the
			attitude that the Southern whites should teach the negroes because it was
			their duty, because it was good policy, and because if they did not do so
			some one else would. The <i>Advertiser</i> of Montgomery stated that
			education was a danger in slavery times but that under freedom ignorance
			became a danger. For a time there were numerous schools taught by crippled
			Confederates and by Southern women.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
      But the education of the negro, like his religious training, was taken
      from the control of the Southern white and was placed under the direction
      of the Northern teachers and missionaries who swarmed into the country
      under the fostering care of the Freedmen's Bureau, the Northern churches,
      and the various Freedmen's Aid Societies. In three years the Bureau spent
      six million dollars on negro schools and everywhere it exercised
      supervision over them. The teachers pursued a policy akin to that of the
      religious leaders. One Southerner likened them to the "plagues of Egypt,"
      another described them as "saints, fools, incendiaries, fakirs, and plain
      business men and women." A Southern woman remarked that "their spirit was
      often high and noble so far as the black man's elevation was concerned,
      but toward the white it was bitter, judicial, and unrelenting." The
      Northern teachers were charged with ignorance of social conditions, with
      fraternizing with the blacks, and with teaching them that the Southerners
      were traitors, "murderers of Lincoln," who had been cruel taskmasters and
      who now wanted to restore servitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reaction against negro education, which began to show itself before
      reconstruction was inaugurated, found expression in the view of most
      whites
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
			that "schooling ruins a negro." A more intelligent opinion was that
      of J.&nbsp;L.&nbsp;M. Curry, a lifelong advocate of negro education:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
		<p class="noindent">
      It is not just to condemn the negro for the education which he received
      in the early years after the war. That was the period of reconstruction,
      the saturnalia of misgovernment, the greatest possible hindrance to the
      progress of the freedmen.&hellip; The education was unsettling,
			demoralizing, [and it] pandered to a wild frenzy for schooling as a quick
			method of reversing social and political conditions. Nothing could have
			been better devised for deluding the poor negro and making him the tool,
			the slave of corrupt taskmasters. Education is a natural consequence of
			citizenship and enfranchisement &hellip; of freedom and humanity. But with
		  deliberate purpose to subject the Southern States to negro domination,
			and secure the States permanently for partisan ends, the education adopted
			was contrary to common-sense, to human experience, to all noble purposes.
			The curriculum was for a people in the highest degree of civilization; the
			aptitude and capabilities and needs of the negro were wholly disregarded.
			Especial stress was laid on classics and liberal culture to bring the race
			<i>per saltum</i> to the same plane with their former masters, and realize
			the theory of social and political equality. A race more highly civilized,
			with best heredities and environments, could not have been coddled with
			more disregard of all the teachings of human history and the necessities
			of the race. Colleges and universities, established and conducted by the
      Freedmen's Bureau and Northern churches and societies, sprang up like
      mushrooms,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
			and the teachers, ignorant, fanatical, without self-poise,
      proceeded to make all possible mischief. It is irrational, cruel, to hold
      the negro, under such strange conditions, responsible for all the ill
      consequences of bad education, unwise teachers, reconstruction villainies,
      and partisan schemes. &sup1;

      Education was to be looked upon as a handmaid to a thorough
      reconstruction, and its general character and aim were determined by the
      Northern teachers. Each convention framed a more or less complicated
      school system and undertook to provide for its support. The negroes in the
      conventions were anxious for free schools; the conservatives were willing;
      but the carpetbaggers and a few mulatto leaders insisted in several States
      upon mixed schools. Only in Louisiana and South Carolina did the
      constitutions actually forbid separate schools; in Mississippi, Florida,
      Alabama, and Arkansas the question was left open, to the embarrassment of
      the whites. Generally the blacks showed no desire for mixed schools unless
      urged to it by the carpetbaggers. In the South Carolina convention a
      mulatto thus argued in favor of mixed schools: "The gentleman from
      Newberry said he was afraid we were taking a wrong
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
			course to remove these
      prejudices. The most natural method to effect this object would be to
      allow children when five or six years of age to mingle in schools together
      and associate generally. Under such training, prejudice must eventually
      die out; but if we postpone it until they become men and women, prejudice
      will be so established that no mortal can obliterate it. This, I think, is
      a sufficient reply to the argument of the gentleman."
    </p>
    <p>
      The state systems were top-heavy with administrative machinery and were
      officered by incompetent and corrupt officials. Such men as Cloud in
      Alabama, Cardozo in Mississippi, Conway in Louisiana, and Jillson in South
      Carolina are fair samples of them. Much of the personnel was taken over
      from the Bureau teaching force. The school officials were no better than
      the other officeholders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first result of the attempt to use the schools as an instrument of
      reconstruction ended in the ruin of several state universities. The
      faculties of the Universities of North Carolina, Mississippi, and Alabama
      were made radical and the institutions thereupon declined to nothing. The
      negroes, unable to control the faculty of the University of South
      Carolina, forced negro students in and thus
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
			got possession. In Louisiana the radical Legislature cut off all funds
			because the university would not admit negroes. The establishment of the
			land grant colleges was an occasion for corruption and embezzlement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The common schools were used for radical ends. The funds set aside for
      them by the state constitutions or appropriated by the legislatures for
      these schools seldom reached their destination without being lessened by
      embezzlement or by plain stealing. Frequently the auditor, or the
      treasurer, or even the Legislature diverted the school funds to other
      purposes. Suffice it to say that all of the reconstruction systems broke
      down financially after a brief existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mixed school provisions in Louisiana and South Carolina and the
      uncertainty of the educational situation in other States caused white
      children to stay away from the public schools. For several years the
      negroes were better provided than the whites, having for themselves both
      all the public schools and also those supported by private benevolence. In
      Mississippi, Louisiana, and South Carolina the whites could get no money
      for schoolhouses, while large sums were spent on negro schools. The
      Peabody Board, then recently
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
			inaugurated, &sup1; refused to co&ouml;perate with school officials in the
			mixed school States and, when criticized, replied: "It is well known
			that we are helping the white children of Louisiana as being the more
			destitute from the fact of their unwillingness to attend mixed schools."

      As was to be expected the whites criticized the attitude of the school
      officials, disapproved of the attempts made in the schools to teach the
      children radical ideas, and objected to the contents of the history texts
      and the "Freedmen's Readers." A white school board in Mississippi, by
      advertising for a Democratic teacher for a negro school, drew the fire of
      a radical editor who inquired: "What is the motive by which this call for
      a 'competent Democratic teacher' is prompted? The most damning that has
      ever moved the heart of man. It is to use the vote and action of a human
      being as a means by which to enslave him. The treachery and villainy of
      these rebels stands without parallel in the history of men."

      A negro politician has left this account of a radical recitation in a
      Florida negro school:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
      After finishing the arithmetic lesson they must next go through the
      catechism:
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is the 'Publican Government of the State of Florida?"
			<span class="answer">Answer</span>: "Governor Starns."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who made him Governor?"
			<span class="answer">Answer</span>: "The colored people."
    </p>
    <p>
      "Who is trying to get him out of his seat?"
			<span class="answer">Answer</span>: "The Democrats, Conover, and some
			white and black Liberal Republicans."
    </p>
    <p>
      "What should the colored people do with the men who is trying to get
      Governor Starns out of his seat?"
			<span class="answer">Answer</span>: "They should kill them." &hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
      This was done that the patrons, some of whom could not read, would be
      impressed by the expressions of their children, and would be ready to put
      any one to death who would come out into the country and say anything
      against Governor Starns.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      The native white teachers soon dropped out of negro schools, and those
      from the North met with the same social persecution as the white church
      workers. The White League and Ku Klux Klan drove off obnoxious teachers,
      whipped some, burned negro schoolhouses, and in various other ways
      manifested the reaction which was rousing the whites against negro
      schools.
    </p>
    <p>
      The several agencies working for negro education gave some training to
      hundreds of thousands of blacks, but the whites asserted that, like the
      church work, it was based on a wrong spirit and resulted in evil as well
      as in good. Free schools
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
			failed in reconstruction because of the
      dishonesty or incompetence of the authorities and because of the unsettled
      race question. It was not until the turn of the century that the white
      schools were again as good as they had been before 1861. After the
      reconstruction native whites as teachers of negro schools were impossible
      in most places. The hostile feelings of the whites resulted and still
      result in a limitation of negro schools. The best thing for negro schools
      that came out of reconstruction was Armstrong's Hampton Institute program,
      which, however, was quite opposed to the spirit of reconstruction
      education.

      Southern States reconstructed by Congress were subject for periods of
      varying length to governments designed by radical Northerners and imposed
      by elements thrown to the surface in the upheaval of Southern society.
      Georgia, Virginia, and North Carolina each had a brief experience with
      these governments; other States escaped after four or five years, while
      Louisiana, South Carolina, and Florida were not delivered from this
      domination until 1876. The States which contained large numbers of negroes
      had, on the whole, the worst experience. Here the officials were ignorant
      or corrupt, frauds upon the public were the rule, not the exception, and
      all of the reconstruction governments were so conducted that they could
      secure no support from the respectable elements of the electorate.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fundamental cause of the failure of these
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
			governments was the character of the new ruling class. Every State,
			except perhaps Virginia, was under the control of a few able leaders
			from the North generally called carpetbaggers and of a few native
			white radicals contemptuously designated scalawags. These were kept
			in power by negro voters, to some seven hundred thousand of whom the
			ballot had been given by the reconstruction acts. The adoption of the
			Fifteenth Amendment in March, 1870, brought the total in the former
			slave States to 931,000, with about seventy-five thousand more negroes
			in the North. The negro voters were most numerous, comparatively, in
			Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Alabama, and Georgia. There
			were a few thousand carpetbaggers in each State, with, at first, a
			much larger number of scalawags. The latter, who were former Unionists,
			former Whigs, Confederate deserters, and a few unscrupulous politicians,
			were most numerous in Virginia, North Carolina, Texas, Arkansas, and
			Tennessee. The better class, however, rapidly left the radical party
			as the character of the new r&eacute;gime became evident, taking with
			them whatever claims the party had to respectability, education,
			political experience, and property.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conservatives, hopelessly reduced by the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
			operation of disfranchising laws, were at first not well organized, nor
			were they at any time as well led as in antebellum days. In 1868 about
			one hundred thousand of them were forbidden to vote and about two
			hundred thousand were disqualified from holding office. The abstention
			policy of 1867-68 resulted in an almost complete withdrawal of the
			influence of the conservatives for the two years, 1868-70. As a class
			they were regarded by the dominant party in State and nation as
			dangerous and untrustworthy and were persecuted in such irritating ways
			that many became indifferent to the appeals of civil duty. They formed
			a solid but almost despairing opposition in the black districts of
			Mississippi, Louisiana, Alabama, and South Carolina. For the leaders
			the price of amnesty was conversion to radicalism, but this price
      few would pay.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new state governments possessed certain characteristics in common.
      Since only a small number of able men were available for office, full
      powers of administration, including appointment and removal, were
      concentrated in the hands of the governor. He exercised a wide control
      over public funds and had authority to organize and command militia and
      constabulary and to call for Federal
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
			troops. The numerous administrative boards worked with the sole object
			of keeping their party in power. Officers were several times as
			numerous as under the old r&eacute;gime, and all of them received higher
			salaries and larger contingent fees. The moral support behind the
			government was that of President Grant and the United States army,
			not that of a free and devoted people.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of the twenty men who served as governors eight were scalawags and twelve
      were carpetbaggers&mdash;men who were abler than the scalawags and who had
			much more than an equal share of the spoils. The scalawags, such as
			Brownlow of Tennessee, Smith of Alabama, and Holden of North Carolina,
			were usually honest but narrow, vindictive men, filled with fear and hate
			of the conservative whites. Of the carpetbaggers half were personally
			honest, but all were unscrupulous in politics. Some were flagrantly
		  dishonest. Governor Moses of South Carolina was several times bribed and
			at one time, according to his own statement, received $15,000 for his vote
			as speaker of the House of Representatives. Governor Stearns of Florida
			was charged with stealing government supplies from the negroes; and it was
			notorious that Warmoth and Kellogg of Louisiana, each of whom served only
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
			one term, retired with large fortunes. Warmoth, indeed, went so far as to
			declare: "Corruption is the fashion. I do not pretend to be honest, but
			only as honest as anybody in politics."
    </p>
    <p>
      The judiciary was no better than the executive. The chief justice of
      Louisiana was convicted of fraud. A supreme court judge of South Carolina
      offered his decisions for sale, and Whipper and Moses, both notorious
      thieves, were elected judges by the South Carolina Legislature. In Alabama
      there were many illiterate magistrates, among them the city judge of
      Selma, who in April, 1865, was still living as a slave. Governor
      Chamberlain, a radical, asserted that there were two hundred trial judges
      in South Carolina who could not read.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other officers were of the same stripe. Leslie, a South Carolina
      carpetbagger, declared that "South Carolina has no right to be a State
      unless she can support her statesmen," and he proceeded to live up to this
      principle. The manager of the state railroad of Georgia, when asked how he
      had been able to accumulate twenty or thirty thousand dollars on a two or
      three thousand dollar salary, replied, "By the exercise of the most rigid
      economy." A North Carolina negro legislator was found on one occasion
      chuckling as he counted
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
			some money. "What are you laughing at, Uncle?" he was asked. "Well, boss,
			I'se been sold 'leben times in my life and dis is de fust time I eber got
			de money." Godkin, in the <i>Nation,</i> said that the Georgia officials
			were "probably as bad a lot of political tricksters and adventurers as
			ever got together in one place." This description will fit equally well
			the white officials of all the reconstructed States. Many of the negroes
			who attained public office showed themselves apt pupils of their
			carpetbag masters but were seldom permitted to appropriate a large
      share of the plunder. In Florida the negro members of the Legislature,
      thinking that they should have a part of the bribe and loot money which
      their carpetbag masters were said to be receiving, went so far as to
      appoint what was known as a "smelling committee" to locate the good things
      and secure a share.
    </p>
    <p>
      From 1868 to 1870 the legislatures of seven States were overwhelmingly
      radical and in several the radical majority held control for four, six, or
      eight years. Negroes were most numerous in the legislatures of Louisiana,
      South Carolina, and Mississippi, and everywhere the votes of these men
      were for sale. In Alabama and Louisiana negro legislators had a fixed
      price for their votes: for
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
			example, six hundred dollars would buy a senator in Louisiana. In South
			Carolina, negro government appeared at its worst. A vivid description of
			the Legislature of this State in which the negroes largely outnumbered
			the whites is given by James S. Pike, a Republican journalist: &sup1;

</div>
    <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      In the place of this old aristocratic society stands the rude form of the
      most ignorant democracy that mankind ever saw, invested with the functions
      of government. It is the dregs of the population habilitated in the robes
      of their intelligent predecessors, and asserting over them the rule of
      ignorance and corruption.&hellip; It is barbarism overwhelming civilization by
      physical force. It is the slave rioting in the halls of his master, and
      putting that master under his feet. And, though it is done without malice
      and without vengeance, it is nevertheless none the less completely and
      absolutely done.&hellip; We will enter the House of Representatives. Here sit
      one hundred and twenty-four members. Of these, twenty-three are white men,
      representing the remains of the old civilization. These are good-looking,
      substantial citizens. They are men of weight and standing in the
      communities they represent. They are all from the hill country. The frosts
      of sixty and seventy winters whiten the heads of some among them. There
      they sit, grim and silent. They feel themselves to be but loose stones,
      thrown in to partially obstruct a current they are powerless to resist.&hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
      This dense negro crowd &hellip; do the debating, the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
			squabbling, the lawmaking,
      and create all the clamor and disorder of the body. These twenty-three
      white men are but the observers, the enforced auditors of the dull and
      clumsy imitation of a deliberative body, whose appearance in their present
      capacity is at once a wonder and a shame to modern civilization.&hellip; The
      Speaker is black, the Clerk is black, the doorkeepers are black, the
      little pages are black, the chairman of the Ways and Means is black, and
      the chaplain is coal black. At some of the desks sit colored men whose
      types it would be hard to find outside of Congo; whose costumes, visages,
      attitudes, and expression, only befit the forecastle of a buccaneer. It
      must be remembered, also, that these men, with not more than a half dozen
      exceptions, have been themselves slaves, and that their ancestors were
      slaves for generations.&hellip;
    </p>
    <p>
      But the old stagers admit that the colored brethren have a wonderful
      aptness at legislative proceedings. They are "quick as lightning" at
      detecting points of order, and they certainly make incessant and
      extraordinary use of their knowledge. No one is allowed to talk five
      minutes without interruption, and one interruption is a signal for another
      and another, until the original speaker is smothered under an avalanche of
      them. Forty questions of privilege will be raised in a day. At times,
      nothing goes on but alternating questions of order and of privilege. The
      inefficient colored friend who sits in the Speaker's chair cannot suppress
      this extraordinary element of the debate. Some of the blackest members
      exhibit a pertinacity of intrusion in raising these points of order and
      questions of privilege that few white men can equal. Their struggles to
      get the floor, their bellowings and physical contortions, baffle
      description.
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
      The Speaker's hammer plays a perpetual tattoo to no purpose. The talking
      and the interruptions from all quarters go on with the utmost license.
      Everyone esteems himself as good as his neighbor, and puts in his oar,
      apparently as often for love of riot and confusion as for anything
      else.&hellip; The Speaker orders a member whom he has discovered to be
      particularly unruly to take his seat. The member obeys, and with the same
      motion that he sits down, throws his feet on to his desk, hiding himself
      from the Speaker by the soles of his boots.&hellip; After a few experiences of
      this sort, the Speaker threatens, in a laugh, to call the "gemman" to
      order. This is considered a capital joke, and a guffaw follows. The laugh
      goes round and then the peanuts are cracked and munched faster than ever;
      one hand being employed in fortifying the inner man with this nutriment of
      universal use, while the other enforces the views of the orator. This
      laughing propensity of the sable crowd is a great cause of disorder. They
      laugh as hens cackle&mdash;one begins and all follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      But underneath all this shocking burlesque upon legislative proceedings,
      we must not forget that there is something very real to this uncouth and
      untutored multitude. It is not all sham, nor all burlesque. They have a
      genuine interest and a genuine earnestness in the business of the assembly
      which we are bound to recognize and respect.&hellip; They have an earnest
      purpose, born of conviction that their position and condition are not
      fully assured, which lends a sort of dignity to their proceedings. The
      barbarous, animated jargon in which they so often indulge is on occasion
      seen to be so transparently sincere and weighty in their own minds that
      sympathy supplants disgust. The whole thing is a wonderful novelty
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
			to them as well as to observers. Seven years ago these men were raising
			corn and cotton under the whip of the overseer. Today they are raising
			points of order and questions of privilege. They find they can raise
			one as well as the other. They prefer the latter. It is easier and
			better paid. Then, it is the evidence of an accomplished result. It
			means escape and defense from old oppressors. It means liberty. It
			means the destruction of prison-walls only too real to them. It is the
		  sunshine of their lives. It is their day of jubilee. It is their
		  long-promised vision of the Lord God Almighty.

      The congressional delegations were as radical as the state governments.
      During the first two years there were no Democratic senators from the
      reconstructed States and only two Democratic representatives, as against
      sixty-four radical senators and representatives. At the end of four years
      the Democrats numbered fifteen against seventy radicals. A negro succeeded
      Jefferson Davis in the Senate, and in all the race sent two senators and
      thirteen representatives to Congress, but though several were of high
      character and fair ability, they exercised practically no influence. The
      Southern delegations had no part in shaping policies but merely voted as
      they were told by the radical leaders.

		<hr class="break" />
    <p>
      The effect of dishonest government was soon seen in extravagant
      expenditures, heavier taxes,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
			increase of the bonded debt, and depression of property values. It was to
			be expected that after the ruin wrought by war and the admission of the
			negro to civil rights, the expenses of government would be greater. But
			only lack of honesty will account for the extraordinary expenses of the
			reconstruction governments. In Alabama and Florida the running expenses
			of the state government increased two hundred per cent, in Louisiana five
			hundred per cent, and in Arkansas fifteen hundred per cent&mdash;all this
			in addition to bond issues. In South Carolina the one item of public
			printing, which from 1790 to 1868 cost $609,000, amounted in the years
			1868-1876 to $1,326,589.
    </p>
    <p>
      Corrupt state officials had two ways of getting money&mdash;by taxation
      and by the sale of bonds. Taxes were everywhere multiplied. The state tax
      rate in Alabama was increased four hundred per cent, in Louisiana eight
      hundred per cent, and in Mississippi, which could issue no bonds, fourteen
      hundred per cent. City and county taxes, where carpetbaggers were in
      control, increased in the same way. Thousands of small proprietors could
      not meet their taxes, and in Mississippi alone the land sold for unpaid
      taxes amounted to six million acres, an area as large as Massachusetts and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
      Rhode Island together. Nordhoff &sup1; speaks of seeing Louisiana
			newspapers of which three-fourths were taken up by notices of tax sales.
			In protest against extravagant and corrupt expenditures, taxpayers'
			conventions were held in every State, but without effect.

      Even the increased taxation, however, did not produce enough to support
      the new governments, which now had recourse to the sale of state and local
      bonds. In this way Governor Holden's Administration managed in two years
      to increase the public debt of North Carolina from $16,000,000 to
      $32,000,000. The state debt of South Carolina rose from $7,000,000 to
      $29,000,000 in 1873. In Alabama, by 1874, the debt had mounted from
      $7,000,000 to $32,000,000. The public debt of Louisiana rose from
      $14,000,000 in 1868 to $48,000,000 in 1871, with a local debt of
      $31,000,000. Cities, towns, and counties sold bonds by the bale. The debt
      of New Orleans increased twenty-five fold and that of Vicksburg a
      thousandfold. A great deal of the debt was the result of fraudulent issues
      of bonds or overissues. For this form of fraud the state financial agents
      in New York were usually
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
			responsible. Southern bonds sold far below par, and the time came when
			they were peddled about at ten to twenty-five cents on the dollar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still another disastrous result followed this corrupt financiering. In
      Alabama there was a sixty-five per cent decrease in property values, in
      Florida forty-five per cent, and in Louisiana fifty to seventy-five
      per cent. A large part of the best property was mortgaged, and foreclosure
      sales were frequent. Poorer property could be neither mortgaged nor sold.
      There was an exodus of whites from the worst governed districts in the
      West and the North. Many towns, among them Mobile and Memphis, surrendered
      their charters and were ruled directly by the governor; and there were
      numerous "strangulated" counties which on account of debt had lost
      self-government and were ruled by appointees of the governor.
    </p>
    <p>
      A part of the money raised by taxes and by bond sales was used for
      legitimate expenses and the rest went to pay forged warrants, excess
      warrants, and swollen mileage accounts, and to fill the pockets of
      embezzlers and thieves from one end of the South to the other. In
      Arkansas, for example, the auditor's clerk hire, which was $4000 in 1866,
      cost twenty-three times as much in 1873. In Louisiana
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
			and South Carolina stealing was elevated into an art and was practiced
			without concealment. In the latter State the worthless Hell Hole Swamp
			was bought for $26,000 to be farmed by the negroes but was charged to
			the state at $120,000. A free restaurant maintained at the Capitol for
			the legislators cost $125,000 for one session. The porter who conducted
			it said that he kept it open sixteen to twenty hours a day and that
			someone was always in the room eating and drinking or smoking. When a
			member left he would fill his pockets with cigars or with bottles of
			drink. Forty different brands of beverages were paid for by the State
			for the private use of members, and all sorts of food, furniture, and
			clothing were sent to the houses of members and were paid for by the
			State as "legislative supplies." On the bills appeared such items as
			imported mushrooms, one side of bacon, one feather bed, bustles, two
			pairs of extra long stockings, one pair of garters, one bottle perfume,
			twelve monogram cut glasses, one horse, one comb and brush, three
			gallons of whisky, one pair of corsets. During the recess, supplies
			 were sent out to the rural homes of the members.
    </p>
    <p>
      The endorsement of railroad securities by the State also furnished a
      source of easy money to
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
			the dishonest official and the crooked speculator.
      After the Civil War, in response to the general desire in the South for
      better railroad facilities, the "Johnson" governments began to underwrite
      railroad bonds. When the carpetbag and negro governments came in, the
      policy was continued but without proper safeguards. Bonds were sometimes
      endorsed before the roads were constructed, and even excess issues were
      authorized. Bonds were endorsed for some roads of which not a mile was
      ever built. The White River Valley and Texas Railroad never came into
      existence, but it obtained a grant of $175,000 from the State of Arkansas.
      Speaker Carter of the Louisiana Legislature received a financial interest
      in all railroad endorsement bills which he steered through the House.
      Negro members were regularly bribed to vote for the bond steals. A witness
      swore that in Louisiana it cost him $80,000 to get a railroad charter
      passed, but that the Governor's signature cost more than the consent of
      the Legislature.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the roads defaulted on the payment of interest, as most of them did,
      the burden fell upon the State. Not all of the blame for this perverted
      legislation should be placed upon the corrupt legislators, however, for
      the lawyers who saw the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
			bills through were frequently Southern Democrats representing supposedly
			respectable Northern capitalists. The railroads as well as the taxpayers
			suffered from this pernicious lobbying, for the companies were loaded
			with debts and rarely profited by the loans. Valuation of railroad
			property rapidly decreased. The roads of Alabama which were valued in
			1871 at $26,000,000 had decreased in 1875 to $9,500,000.

      The foundation of radical power in the South lay in the alienation of the
      races which had been accomplished between 1865 and 1868. To maintain this
      unhappy distrust, the radical leaders found an effective means in the
      negro militia. Under the constitution of every reconstructed State a
      negro constabulary was possible, but only in South Carolina, North
      Carolina, Louisiana, and Mississippi were the authorities willing to risk
      the dangers of arming the blacks. No governor dared permit the Southern
      whites to organize as militia. In South Carolina the carpetbag governor,
      Robert K. Scott, enrolled ninety-six thousand negroes as members of the
      militia and organized and armed twenty thousand of them. The few white
      companies were ordered to disband. In Louisiana the governor
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
			had a standing army of blacks called the Metropolitan Guard. In several
			States the negro militia was used as a constabulary and was sent to any
			part of the State to make arrests.
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of this provocation there were, after the riots of 1866-67,
      comparatively few race conflicts until reconstruction was drawing to a
      close. The intervening period was filled with the more peaceful activities
      of the Ku Klux Klan and the White Camelia. &sup1; But as the whites made
			up their minds to get rid of negro rule, the clashes came frequently and
      always ended in the death of more negroes than whites. &sup2; They would
      probably have continued with serious consequences if the whites had not
      eventually secured control of the government.

      <a id="footer_10-4" name="footer_10-4"></a>
&sup2; Among the bloodiest conflicts were those in Louisiana at
     Colfax, Coushatta, and New Orleans in 1873-74, and at
     Vicksburg and Clinton, Mississippi, in 1874-75.</p>
</div>

    <p>
      The lax election laws, framed indeed for the benefit of the party in
      power, gave the radicals ample opportunity to control the negro vote. The
      elections were frequently corrupt, though not a great deal of money was
      spent in bribery. It was found less expensive to use other methods of
      getting out the vote. The negroes were generally
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
			made to understand that
      the Democrats wanted to put them back into slavery, but sometimes the
      leaders deemed it wiser to state more concretely that "Jeff Davis had come
      to Montgomery and is ready to organize the Confederacy again" if the
      Democrats should win; or to say that "if Carter is elected, he will not
      allow your wives and daughters to wear hoopskirts." In Alabama many
      thousand pounds of bacon and hams were sent in to be distributed among
      "flood sufferers" in a region which had not been flooded since the days of
      Noah. The negroes were told that they must vote right and receive enough
      bacon for a year, or "lose their rights" if they voted wrongly. Ballot-box
      stuffing developed into an art, and each negro was carefully inspected to
      see that he had the right kind of ticket before he was marched to the
      polls.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspection and counting of election returns were in the hands of the
      county and state boards, which were controlled by the governor, and which
      had authority to throw out or count in any number of votes. On the
      assumption that the radicals were entitled to all negro votes, the
      returning boards followed the census figures for the black population in
      order to arrive at the minimum radical vote. The action of the returning
      boards
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
			was specially flagrant in Louisiana and Florida and in the black
      counties of South Carolina.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notwithstanding the fact that the very best arrangements had been made at
      Washington and in the States for the running of the radical machine,
      everywhere there were factional fights from the beginning. Usually the
      scalawags declared hostilities after they found that the carpetbaggers had
      control of the negroes and the inside track on the way to the best state
      and federal offices. Later, after the scalawags had for the most part left
      the radicals, there were contests among the carpetbaggers themselves for
      the control of the negro vote and the distribution of spoils. The defeated
      faction usually joined the Democrats. In Arkansas a split started in 1869
      which by 1872 resulted in two state governments. Alabama in 1872 and
      Louisiana in 1874-75 each had two rival governments. This factionalism
      contributed largely to the overthrow of the radicals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The radical structure, however, was still powerfully supported from
      without. Relations between the Federal Government and the state
      governments in the South were close, and the policy at Washington was
      frequently determined by conditions in the South. President Grant, though
      at
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
			first considerate, was usually consistently radical in his Southern
      policy. This attitude is difficult to explain except by saying that Grant
      fell under the control of radical advisers after his break with Johnson,
      that his military instincts were offended by opposition in the South which
      his advisers told him was rebellious, and that he was impressed by the
      need of holding the Southern radical vote against the inroads of the
      Democrats. After about 1869 Grant never really understood the conditions
      in the South. He was content to control by means of Federal troops and
      thousands of deputy marshals. For this policy the Ku Klux activities gave
      sufficient excuse for a time, and the continued story of "rebel outrages"
      was always available to justify a call for soldiers or deputies. The
      enforcement legislation gave the color of law to any interference which
      was deemed necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Federal troops served other ends than the mere preservation of order and
      the support of the radical state governments. They were used on occasion
      to decide between opposing factions and to oust conservatives who had
      forced their way into office. The army officers purged the Legislature of
      Georgia in 1870, that of Alabama in 1872, and that of Louisiana in 1875.
      In 1875 the city government
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
			of Vicksburg and the state government of Louisiana were overturned by
			the whites, but General Sheridan at once intervened to put back the
			negroes and carpetbaggers. He suggested to President Grant that the
			conservatives be declared "banditti" and he would make himself
			responsible for the rest. As soon as a State showed signs of going over
			to the Democrats or an important election was lost by the radicals, one
			House or the other of Congress in many instances sent an investigation
			committee to ascertain the reasons. The Committees on the Condition of
			the South or on the Late Insurrectionary States were nearly always ready
			with reports to establish the necessity of intervention.
    </p>
    <p>
      Besides the army there was in every State a powerful group of Federal
      officials who formed a "ring" for the direction of all good radicals.
      These marshals, deputies, postmasters, district attorneys, and customhouse
      officials were in close touch with Washington and frequently dictated
      nominations and platforms. At New Orleans the officials acted as a
      committee on credentials and held all the state conventions under their
      control in the customhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such was the machinery used to sustain a party
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
			which, with the gradual defection of the whites, became throughout the
			South almost uniformly black. At first few negroes asked for offices,
			but soon the carpetbaggers found it necessary to divide with the rapidly
			growing number of negro politicians. No negro was elected governor,
			though several reached the office of lieutenant governor, secretary of
			state, auditor, superintendent of education, justice of the state supreme
			court, and fifteen were elected to Congress. &sup1; It would not be
			correct to say that the negro race was malicious or on evil bent. Unless
			deliberately stirred up by white leaders, few negroes showed signs of
			mean spirit. Few even made exorbitant demands. They wanted
			"something"&mdash;schools and freedom and "something else," they knew not
			what. Deprived of the leadership of the best whites, they could not
			possibly act with the scalawags&mdash;their traditional enemies. Nothing
			was left for them but to follow the carpetbagger.

    </h2>
		<p class="chaptertitle">The Ku Klux Movement</p>
		<p class="noindent"><span class="first-word">The</span>
      Ku Klux movement, which took the form of secret revolutionary
      societies, grew out of a general conviction among the whites that the
      reconstruction policies were impossible and not to be endured. Somers, an
      English traveler, says that at this time "nearly every respectable white
      man in the Southern States was not only disfranchised but under fear of
      arrest or confiscation; the old foundations of authority were utterly
      razed before any new ones had yet been laid, and in the dark and benighted
      interval the remains of the Confederate armies&mdash;swept after a long
      and heroic day of fair fight from the field&mdash;flitted before the eyes
      of the people in this weird and midnight shape of a Ku Klux Klan." Ryland
      Randolph, an Alabama editor who was also an official of the Klan, stated
      in his paper that "the origin of Ku Klux Klan is in the galling despotism
      that broods like a night-mare
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
			over these Southern States&mdash;a fungus
      growth of military tyranny superinduced by the fostering of Loyal Leagues,
      the abrogation of our civil laws, the habitual violation of our national
      Constitution, and a persistent prostitution of all government, all
      resources and all powers, to degrade the white man by the establishment of
      negro supremacy."
    </p>
    <p>
      The secret orders, regardless of their original purposes, were all finally
      to be found opposing radical reconstruction. Everywhere their objects were
      the same: to recover for the white race their former control of society
      and government, and to destroy the baneful influence of the alien among
      the blacks. The people of the South were by law helpless to take steps
      towards setting up any kind of government in a land infested by a vicious
      element&mdash;Federal and Confederate deserters, bushwhackers, outlaws of
      every description, and negroes, some of whom proved insolent and violent
      in their newly found freedom. Nowhere was property or person safe, and for
      a time many feared a negro insurrection. General Hardee said to his
      neighbors, "I advise you to get ready for what may come. We are standing
      over a sleeping volcano."
    </p>
    <p>
      To cope with this situation ante-bellum patrols&mdash;the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
			"patter-rollers" as the negroes called them&mdash;were often secretly
			reorganized. In each community for several months after the Civil War,
			and in many of them for months before the end of the war, there were
			informal vigilance committees. Some of these had such names as the Black
			Cavalry and Men of Justice in Alabama, the Home Guards in many other
			places, while the anti-Confederate societies of the war, the Heroes of
			America, the Red Strings, and the Peace Societies, transformed themselves
			in certain localities into regulatory bodies. Later these secret
			societies numbered scores, perhaps hundreds, varying from small bodies
			of local police to great federated bodies which covered almost the entire
			South and even had membership in the North and West. Other important
			organizations were the Constitutional Union Guards, the Pale Faces, the
		  White Brotherhood, the Council of Safety, the '76 Association, the Sons
			of '76, the Order of the White Rose, and the White Boys. As the fight
			against reconstruction became bolder, the orders threw off their
			disguises and appeared openly as armed whites fighting for the control
			of society. The White League of Louisiana, the White Line of Mississippi,
			the White Man's party of Alabama, and the Rifle
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
      Clubs of South Carolina, were later manifestations of the general Ku Klux
      movement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two largest secret orders, however, were the Ku Klux Klan, from which
      the movement took its name, and the Knights of the White Camelia. The Ku
      Klux Klan originated at Pulaski, Tennessee, in the autumn of 1865, as a
      local organization for social purposes. The founders were young
      Confederates, united for fun and mischief. The name was an accidental
      corruption of the Greek word <i>Kuklos</i>, a circle. The officers adopted
			queer sounding titles and strange disguises. Weird night riders in ghostly
			attire thoroughly frightened the superstitious negroes, who were told that
			the spirits of dead Confederates were abroad. This terrorizing of the
			blacks successfully provided the amusement which the founders desired and
			there were many applications for admission to the society. The Pulaski
			Club, or Den, was in the habit of parading in full uniform at social
			gatherings of the whites at night, much to the delight of the small boys
			and girls. Pulaski was near the Alabama line, and many of the young men of
			Alabama who saw these parades or heard of them organized similar Dens in
			the towns of Northern Alabama. Nothing but horseplay, however, took
			place at the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
      meetings. In 1867 and 1868 the order appeared in parade in the towns of
      the adjoining States and, as we are told, "cut up curious gyrations" on
      the public squares.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a general belief outside the order that there was a purpose
      behind all the ceremonial and frolic of the Dens; many joined the order
      convinced that its object was serious; others saw the possibilities of
      using it as a means of terrorizing the negroes. After men discovered the
      power of the Klan over the negroes, indeed, they were generally inclined,
      owing to the disordered conditions of the time, to act as a sort of police
      patrol and to hold in check the thieving negroes, the Union League, and
      the "loyalists." In this way, from being merely a number of social clubs
      the Dens swiftly became bands of regulators, taking on many new fantastic
      qualities along with their new seriousness of purpose. Some of the more
      ardent spirits led the Dens far in the direction of violence and outrage.
      Attempts were made by the parent Den at Pulaski to regulate the conduct of
      the others, but, owing to the loose organization, the effort met with
      little success. Some of the Dens, indeed, lost all connection with the
      original order.
    </p>
    <p>
      A general organization of these societies was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
			perfected at a convention held in Nashville in May, 1867, just as the
			Reconstruction Acts were being put into operation. A constitution called
			the <i>Prescript</i> was adopted which provided for a national
			organization. The former slave States, except Delaware, constituted the
			Empire, which was ruled by the Grand Wizard (then General Forrest) with
			a staff of ten Genii; each State was a realm under a Grand Dragon and
			eight Hydras; the next subdivision was a Dominion, consisting of several
			counties, ruled by a Grand Titan and six Furies; the county or Province
			was governed by a Grand Giant and four Goblins; the unit was the Den or
			community organization, of which there might be several in each county,
			each under a Grand Cyclops and two Nighthawks. The Genii, Hydras, Furies,
			Goblins, and Nighthawks were staff officers. The private members were
			called Ghouls. The order had no name, and at first was designated by
			two stars (**), later by three (***). Sometimes it was called the
			Invisible Empire of Ku Klux Klan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any white man over eighteen might be admitted to the Den after nomination
      by a member and strict investigation by a committee. The oath demanded
      obedience and secrecy. The Dens governed themselves by the ordinary rules
      of
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
			deliberative bodies. The punishment for betrayal of secrecy was "the
      extreme penalty of the Law." None of the secrets was to be written, and
      there was a "Register" of alarming adjectives, such as terrible, horrible,
      furious, doleful, bloody, appalling, frightful, gloomy, which was used as
      a cipher code in dating the odd Ku Klux orders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The general objects of the order were thus set forth in the revised
      <i>Prescript</i>: first, to protect the weak, the innocent, and the
			defenseless from the indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the lawless,
			the violent, and the brutal; to relieve the injured and oppressed; to
			succor the suffering and unfortunate, and especially the widows and
			orphans of Confederate soldiers; second, to protect and defend the
			Constitution of the United States and all laws passed in conformity
			thereto, and to protect the States and people thereof from all invasion
			from any source whatever; third, to aid and assist in the execution of all
      "constitutional" laws, and to protect the people from unlawful arrest, and
      from trial except by their peers according to the laws of the land. But
      the tests for admission gave further indication of the objects of the
      order. No Republican, no Union Leaguer, and no member of the
			G.&nbsp;A.&nbsp;R. might become a member. The members
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
			were pledged to oppose negro equality of any kind, to favor emancipation
			of the Southern whites and the restoration of their rights, and to
			maintain constitutional government and equitable laws.
    </p>
    <p>
      Prominent men testified that the order became popular because the whites
      felt that they were persecuted and that there was no legal protection, no
      respectable government. General (later Senator) Pettus said that through
      all the workings of the Federal Government ran the principle that "we are
      an inferior, degraded people and not fit to be trusted." General Clanton
      of Alabama further explained that "there is not a respectable white woman
      in the Negro Belt of Alabama who will trust herself outside of her house
      without some protector.&hellip; So far as our State Government is
			concerned, we are in the hands of camp-followers, horse-holders, cooks,
			bottle-washers, and thieves.&hellip; We have passed out from the hands of
			the brave soldiers who overcame us, and are turned over to the tender
			mercies of squaws for torture.&hellip; I see negro police&mdash;great
			black fellows&mdash;leading white girls around the streets of Montgomery,
			and locking them up in jails."
    </p>
    <p>
      The Klan first came into general prominence in 1868 with the report of the
      Federal commanders in
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
			the South concerning its activities. Soon after that date the order
			spread through the white counties of the South, in many places absorbing
			the White Brotherhood, the Pale Faces, and some other local organizations
			which had been formed in the upper part of the Black Belt. But it was not
			alone in the field. The order known as the Knights of the White Camelia,
			founded in Louisiana in 1867 and formally organized in 1868, spread
			rapidly over the lower South until it reached the territory occupied by
			the Ku Klux Klan. It was mainly a Black Belt order, and on the whole had
			a more substantial and more conservative membership than the other large
			secret bodies. Like the Ku Klux Klan, it also absorbed several minor
			local societies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The White Camelia had a national organization with headquarters in New
      Orleans. Its business was conducted by a Supreme Council of the United
      States, with Grand, Central, and Subordinate Councils for each State,
      county, and community. All communication within the order took place by
      passwords and cipher; the organization and the officers were similar to
      those of the Ku Klux Klan; and all officers were designated by initials.
      An ex-member states that "during the three years of its existence here
      [Perry County, Alabama] I believe
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
			its organization and discipline were as perfect as human ingenuity could
			have made it." The fundamental object of the White Camelia was the
			"maintenance of the supremacy of the white race," and to this end the
			members were constrained "to observe a marked distinction between the
			races" and to restrain the "African race to that condition of social and
			political inferiority for which God has destined it." The members were
			pledged to vote only for whites, to oppose negro equality in all things,
			but to respect the legitimate rights of negroes.
    </p>
    <p>
      The smaller orders were similar in purpose and organization to the Ku Klux
      Klan and the White Camelia. Most of them joined or were affiliated with
      the large societies. Probably a majority of the men of the South were
      associated at some time during this period with these revolutionary
      bodies. As a rule the politicians, though approving, held aloof. Public
      opinion generally supported the movement so long as the radicals made
      serious attempts to carry out the reconstruction policies.
    </p>
    <p>
      The task before the secret orders was to regulate the conduct of the
      blacks and their leaders in order that honor, life, and property might be
      secure. They planned to accomplish this aim by playing
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
			upon the fears, superstitions, and cowardice of the black race&mdash;in a
			word, by creating a white terror to counteract the black one. To this end
			they made use of strange disguises, mysterious and fearful conversation,
			midnight rides and drills, and silent parades. As long as secrecy and
			mystery were to be effective in dealing with the negroes, costume was an
			important matter. These disguises varied with the locality and often with
			the individual. High cardboard hats, covered with white cloth often
			decorated with stars or pictures of animals, white masks with holes cut
			for eyes, nose and mouth bound with red braid to give a horrible
			appearance, and frequently a long tongue of red flannel so fixed that it
			could be moved with the wearer's tongue, and a long white robe&mdash;these
			made up a costume which served at the same time as a disguise and as a
			means of impressing the impressionable negro. Horses were covered with
			sheets or white cloth held on by the saddle and by belts, and sometimes
			the animals were even painted. Skulls of sheep and cattle, and even of
			human beings were often carried on the saddlebows to add another element
			of terror. A framework was sometimes made to fit the shoulders of a Ghoul
			which caused him to appear twelve feet high. A
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
			skeleton wooden hand at the end of a stick served to greet terrified
			negroes at midnight. For safety every man carried a small whistle and
			a brace of pistols.
    </p>
    <p>
      The trembling negro who ran into a gathering of the Ku Klux on his return
      from a Loyal League meeting was informed that the white-robed figures he
      saw were the spirits of the Confederate dead killed at Chickamauga or
      Shiloh, now unable to rest in their graves because of the conduct of the
      negroes. He was told in a sepulchral voice of the necessity for his
      remaining more at home and taking a less active part in predatory
      excursions abroad. In the middle of the night a sleeping negro might wake
      to find his house surrounded by a ghostly company, or to see several
      terrifying figures standing by his bedside. They were, they said, the
      ghosts of men whom he had formerly known. They had scratched through from
      Hell to warn the negroes of the consequences of their misconduct. Hell was
      a dry and thirsty land: and they asked him for water. Bucket after bucket
      of water disappeared into a sack of leather, rawhide, or rubber, concealed
      within the flowing robe. The story is told of one of these night travelers
      who called at the cabin of a radical negro in Attakapas
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
			County, Louisiana.
      After drinking three buckets of water to the great astonishment of the
      darky, the traveler thanked him and told him that he had traveled nearly a
      thousand miles within twenty-four hours, and that that was the best water
      he had tasted since he was killed at the battle of Shiloh. The negro
      dropped the bucket, overturned chairs and table in making his escape
      through the window, and was never again seen or heard of by residents of
      that community. Another incident is told of a parade in Pulaski,
      Tennessee: "While the procession was passing a corner on which a negro man
      was standing, a tall horseman in hideous garb turned aside from the line,
      dismounted and stretched out his bridle rein toward the negro, as if he
      desired him to hold his horse. Not daring to refuse, the frightened
      African extended his hand to grasp the rein. As he did so, the Ku Klux
      took his own head from his shoulders and offered to place that also in the
      outstretched hand. The negro stood not upon the order of his going, but
      departed with a yell of terror. To this day he will tell you: 'He done it,
      suah, boss. I seed him do it.'"
    </p>
    <p>
      It was seldom necessary at this early stage to use violence, for the black
      population was in an ecstasy of fear. A silent host of white-sheeted
      horsemen
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">256</a></span>
			parading the country roads at night was sufficient to reduce the
      blacks to good behavior for weeks or months. One silent Ghoul posted near
      a meeting place of the League would be the cause of the immediate
      dissolution of that club. Cow bones in a sack were rattled within earshot
      of the terrified negroes. A horrible being, fifteen feet tall, walking
      through the night toward a place of congregation, was very likely to find
      that every one had vacated the place before he arrived. A few figures
      wrapped in sheets and sitting on tombstones in a graveyard near which
      negroes were accustomed to pass would serve to keep the immediate
      community quiet for weeks and give the locality a reputation for "hants"
      which lasted long.
    </p>
    <p>
      To prevent detection on parade, members of the Klan often stayed out of
      the parade in their own town and were to be seen freely and conspicuously
      mingling with the spectators. A man who believed that he knew every horse
      in the vicinity and was sure that he would be able to identify the riders
      by their horses was greatly surprised upon lifting the disguise of the
      horse nearest him to find the animal upon which he himself had ridden into
      town a short while before. The parades were always silent and so arranged
      as to give the impression of very large
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
			numbers. In the regular drills which were held in town and country the
			men showed that they had not forgotten their training in the Confederate
			army. There were no commands save in a very low tone or in a mysterious
			language, and usually only signs or whistle signals were used.
    </p>
    <p>
      Such pacific methods were successful to a considerable degree until the
      carpetbaggers and scalawags were placed in office under the Reconstruction
      Acts. Then more violent methods were necessary. The Klans patrolled
      disturbed communities, visited, warned, and frightened obnoxious
      individuals, whipped some, and even hanged others. Until forbidden by law
      or military order, the newspapers were accustomed to print the mysterious
      proclamations of the Ku Klux. The following, which was circulated in
      Montgomery, Alabama, in April 1868, is a typical specimen:

      The work of the secret orders was successful. As bodies of vigilantes, the
      Klans and the Councils regulated the conduct of bad negroes, punished
      criminals who were not punished by the State, looked after the activities
      and teachings of Northern preachers and teachers, dispersed hostile
      gatherings of negroes, and ran out of the community the worst of the
      reconstructionist officials. They kept the negroes quiet and freed them to
      some extent from the influence of evil leaders. The burning of houses,
      gins, mills, and stores ceased; property became more secure; people slept
      safely at night; women and children walked abroad in security; the
      incendiary agents who had worked among the negroes left the country;
      agitators, political, educational, and religious, became more moderate;
      "bad niggers" ceased to be bad; labor became less disorganized; the
      carpetbaggers and scalawags ceased to batten on the Southern communities.
      It was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
			not so much a revolution as the defeat of a revolution. Society was
      replaced in the old historic grooves from which war and reconstruction had
      jarred it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Successful as was the Ku Klux movement in these respects, it had at the
      same time many harmful results. Too often local orders fell under the
      control of reckless or lawless men and the Klan was then used as a cloak
      to cover violence and thievery; family and personal feuds were carried
      into the orders and fought out; and anti-negro feeling in many places
      found expression in activities designed to drive the blacks from the
      country. It was easy for any outlaw to hide himself behind the protection
      of a secret order. So numerous did these men become that after 1868 there
      was a general exodus of the leading reputable members, and in 1869 the
      formal disbanding of the Klan was proclaimed by General Forrest, the Grand
      Wizard. The White Camelia and other orders also gradually went out of
      existence. Numerous attempts were made to suppress the secret movement by
      the military commanders, the state governments, and finally by Congress,
      but none of these was entirely successful, for in each community the
      secret opposition lasted as long as it was needed.
	</p>
	<p>
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
			The political effects of the orders, however, survived their organized
			existence. Some of the Southern States began to go Democratic in spite
			of the Reconstruction Acts and the Amendments, and there was little
			doubt that the Ku Klux movement had aided in this change. In order to
			preserve the achievements of radical reconstruction Congress passed, in
			1870 and 1871, the enforcement acts which had been under debate for
			nearly two years. The first act (May 31, 1870) was designed to protect
			the negro's right to vote and was directed at individuals as well as
			against States. Section six, indeed, was aimed specifically at the Ku
			Klux Klan. This act was a long step in the direction of giving the
			Federal Government control over state elections. But as North Carolina
			went wholly and Alabama partially Democratic in 1870, a Supplementary
			Act (February 28, 1871) went further and placed the elections for
			members of Congress completely under Federal control, and also authorized
			the use of thousands of deputy marshals at elections. As the campaign of
			1872 drew near, Grant and his advisers became solicitous to hold all the
			Southern States which had not been regained by the Democrats. Accordingly,
			on March 23, 1871, the President sent a message to Congress declaring
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
			that in some of the States the laws could not be enforced and asked for
			remedial legislation. Congress responded with an act (April 20, 1871),
			commonly called the "Ku Klux Act," which gave the President despotic
			military power to uphold the remaining negro governments and authorized
			him to declare a state of war when he considered it necessary. Of this
			power Grant made use in only one instance. In October, 1871, he declared
			nine counties of South Carolina in rebellion and put them under martial
			law.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the ten years following 1870, several thousand arrests were made
      under the enforcement acts and about 1250 convictions were secured,
      principally in Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.
      Most of these violations of election laws, however, had nothing to do with
      the Ku Klux movement, for by 1870 the better class of members had
      withdrawn from the secret orders. But though the enforcement acts checked
      these irregularities to a considerable extent, they nevertheless failed to
      hold the South for the radicals and essential parts of them were declared
      unconstitutional a few years later.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to justify the passage of the enforcement acts and to obtain
      campaign material for use
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">262</a></span>
			in 1872, Congress appointed a committee, organized on the very day when
			the Ku Klux Act was approved, to investigate conditions in the Southern
			States. From June to August, 1871, the committee took testimony in
			Washington, and in the fall subcommittees visited several Southern States.
			Tennessee, Virginia, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Texas were, however,
			omitted from the investigation. Notwithstanding the partisan purpose and
			methods of the investigation, the report of the committee and the
			accompanying testimony constituted a Democratic rather than a Republican
			document. It is a veritable mine of information about the South between
			1865 and 1871. The Democratic minority members made skillful use of their
			opportunity to expose conditions in the South. They were less concerned
			to meet the charges made against the Ku Klux Klan than to show why such
			movements came about. The Republicans, concerned mainly about material
			for the presidential campaign, neglected the broader phases of the
			situation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Opposition to the effects of reconstruction did not come to an end with
      the dissolution of the more famous orders. On the contrary, it now became
      public and open and resulted in the organization,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
			after 1872, of the White League, the Mississippi Shot Gun Plan, the White
			Man's Party in Alabama, and the Rifle Clubs in South Carolina. The later
			movements were distinctly but cautiously anti-negro. There was most
			irritation in the white counties where there were large numbers of
			negroes. Negro schools and churches were burned because they served as
			meeting places for negro political organizations. The color line began
			to be more and more sharply drawn. Social and business ostracism
			continued to be employed against white radicals, while the negroes were
			discharged from employment or were driven from their rented farms.
    </p>
		<hr class="break" />
    <p>
      The Ku Klux movement, it is to be noted in retrospect, originated as an
      effort to restore order in the war-stricken Southern States. The secrecy
      of its methods appealed to the imagination and caused its rapid expansion,
      and this secrecy was inevitable because opposition to reconstruction was
      not lawful. As the reconstruction policies were put into operation, the
      movement became political and used violence when appeals to superstitious
      fears ceased to be effective. The Ku Klux Klan centered, directed, and
      crystallized public opinion, and united the whites upon a platform of
      white
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
			supremacy. The Southern politicians stood aloof from the movement
      but accepted the results of its work. It frightened the negroes and bad
      whites into better conduct, and it encouraged the conservatives and aided
      them to regain control of society, for without the operations of the Klan
      the black districts would never have come again under white control.
      Towards the end, however, its methods frequently became unnecessarily
      violent and did great harm to Southern society. The Ku Klux system of
      regulating society is as old as history; it had often been used before; it
      may even be used again. When a people find themselves persecuted by aliens
      under legal forms, they will invent some means outside the law for
      protecting themselves; and such experiences will inevitably result in a
      weakening of respect for law and in a return to more primitive methods of
      justice.

    </h2>
		<p class="chaptertitle">The Changing South</p>
		<p class="noindent"><span class="first-word">"The</span>
      bottom rail is on top" was a phrase which had flashed throughout the
      late Confederate States. It had been coined by the negroes in 1867 to
      express their view of the situation, but its aptness had been recognized
      by all. After ten years of social and economic revolution, however, it was
      not so clear that the phrase of 1867 correctly described the new
      situation. "The white man made free" would have been a more accurate
      epitome, for the white man had been able, in spite of his temporary
      disabilities, to compete with the negro in all industries.
    </p>
    <p>
      It will be remembered that the negro districts were least exposed to the
      destruction of war. The well-managed plantation, lying near the highways
      of commerce, with its division of labor, nearly or quite self-sufficing,
      was the bulwark of the Confederacy. When the fighting ended, an industrial
      revolution began in these untouched parts of the
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
			Black Belt. The problem of free negro labor now appeared. During the year
			1865 no general plan for a labor system was formulated except by the
			Freedmen's Bureau. That, however, was not a success. There were all sorts
			of makeshifts, such as cash wages, deferred wages, co&ouml;peration, even
			sharing of expense and product, and contracts, either oral or written.
    </p>
    <p>
      The employers showed a disposition to treat the negro family as a unit in
      making contracts for labor, wages, food, clothes, and care. &sup1; In
			general these early arrangements were made to transform slavery with its
			mutual duties and obligations into a free labor system with wages and
      "privileges." The "privileges" of slavery could not be destroyed; in fact,
      they have never yet been destroyed in numerous places. Curious demands
      were made by the negroes: here, farm bells must not ring; there, overseers
      or managers must be done away with; in some places plantation courts were
      to settle matters of work, rent, and conduct; elsewhere, agreements were
      made that on Saturday the laborer
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
			should be permitted to go to town and, perhaps, ride a mule or horse.
			In South Carolina the Sea Island negroes demanded that in laying out
			work the old "tasks" or "stints" of slavery days be retained as the
			standard. The farming districts at the edge of the Black Belt, where
			the races were about equal in numbers, already had a kind of "share
			system," and in these sections the economic chaos after the war was
			not so complete. The former owners worked in the field with their
      ex-slaves and thus provided steady employment for many. Farms were rented
      for a fixed sum of money, or for a part of the crop, or on "shares."
    </p>
		<div class="footer">
		  <p>
      <a id="footer_12-1" name="footer_12-1"></a>
     &sup1; J.&nbsp;D.&nbsp;B. De Bow, the economist, testified before the Joint
     Committee on Reconstruction that, if the negro would work,
     free labor would be better for the planters than slave
     labor. He called attention to the fact, however, that negro
     women showed a desire to avoid field labor, and there is
     also evidence to show that they objected to domestic service
     and other menial work.</p>
</div>

    <p>
      The white districts, which had previously fought a losing competition with
      the efficiently managed and inexpensive slave labor of the Black Belt,
      were affected most disastrously by war and its aftermath. They were
      distant from transportation lines and markets; they employed poor farming
      methods; they had no fertilizers; they raised no staple crops on their
      infertile land; and in addition they now had to face the destitution that
      follows fighting. Yet these regions had formerly been almost
      self-supporting, although the farms were small and no elaborate labor
      system had been developed.
		</p>
		<p>
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
			In the planting districts where the owner was land-poor he made an
			attempt to bring in Northern capital and Northern or foreign labor. In
			the belief that the negroes would work better for a Northern man, every
			planter who could do so secured a Northern partner or manager, frequently
			a soldier. Nevertheless these imported managers nearly always failed
			because they did not understand cotton, rice, or sugar planting, and
			because they were either too severe or too easy upon the blacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      No Northern labor was to be had, and the South could not retain even all
      its own native whites. Union soldiers and others seeking to better their
      prospects moved west and northwest to fill the newly opened lands, while
      the Confederates, kept out of the homestead region by the test oath,
      swarmed into Texas, which owned its own public lands, or went North to
      other occupations. Nor could the desperate planters hire foreign
      immigrants. Several States, among them South Carolina, Alabama, and
      Louisiana, advertised for laborers and established labor bureaus, but
      without avail. The negro politicians in 1867 declared themselves opposed
      to all movements to foster immigration. So in the Black Belt the negro
      had, for forty years, a monopoly of farm labor.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span>
      The share system of tenantry, with its attendant evils of credit and crop
      lien, was soon established in the Southern States, mainly in the Black
      Belt, but to some extent also in the white districts. The landlord
      furnished land, house, fuel, water, and all or a part of the seed,
      fertilizer, farm implements, and farm animals. In return he received a
      "half," or a "third and fourth," his share depending upon how much he had
      furnished. The best class of tenants would rent for cash or a fixed
      rental, the poorest laborers would work for wages only.
    </p>
    <p>
      The "privileges" brought over from slavery, which were included in the
      share renting, astonished outside observers. To the laborer was usually
      given a house, a water supply, wood for fuel, pasture for pigs or cows, a
      "patch" for vegetables and fruit, and the right to hunt and fish. These
      were all that some needed in order to live. Somers, the English traveler
      already quoted, pronounced this generous custom "outrageously absurd," for
      the negroes had so many privileges that they refused to make use of their
      opportunities. "The soul is often crushed out of labor by penury and
      oppression," he said, "but here a soul cannot begin to be infused into it
      through the sheer excess of privilege and license with which it is
      surrounded."

			The credit system which was developed beside the share system
      made a bad condition worse. On the 1st of January, a planter could
      mortgage his future crop to a merchant or landlord in exchange for
      subsistence until the harvest. Since, as a rule, neither tenant nor
      landlord had any surplus funds, the latter would be supplied by the banker
      or banker merchant, who would then dictate the crops to be planted and the
      time of sale. As a result of these conditions, the planter or farmer was
      held to staple crops, high prices for necessities, high interest rate, and
      frequently unfair bookkeeping. The system was excellent for a thrifty,
      industrious, and intelligent man, for it enabled him to get a start. It
      worked to the advantage of a bankrupt landlord, who could in this way get
      banking facilities. But it had a mischievous effect upon the average
      tenant, who had too small a share of the crop to feel a strong sense of
      responsibility as well as too many "privileges" and too little supervision
      to make him anxious to produce the best results.
    </p>
    <p>
      The negroes entered into their freedom with several advantages: they were
      trained to labor; they were occupying the most fertile soil and could
      purchase land at low prices; the tenant system was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
			most liberal; cotton, sugar, and rice were bringing high prices; and
			access to markets was easy. In the white districts land was cheap, and
			prices of commodities were high, but otherwise the negroes seemed to have
			the better position. Yet as early as 1870, keen observers called attention
			to the fact that the hill and mountain whites were thriving as compared
			with their former condition, and that the negroes were no longer their
			serious competitors. In the white districts better methods were coming
			into use, labor was steady, fertilizers were used, and conditions of
			transportation were improving. The whites were also encroaching on the
			Black Belt; they were opening new lands in the Southwest; and within the
			border of the Black Belt they were bringing negro labor under some
			control. In the South Carolina rice lands, crowds of Irish were imported
			to do the ditching which the negroes refused to do and were carried back
			North when the job was finished. &sup1; President Thach
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
			of the Alabama Agricultural College has thus described the
      situation:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      By the use of commercial fertilizers, vast regions once considered barren
      have been brought into profitable cultivation, and really afford a more
      reliable and constant crop than the rich alluvial lands of the old slave
      plantations. In nearly every agricultural county in the South there is to
      be observed, on the one hand, this section of fertile soils, once the
      heart of the old civilization, now abandoned by the whites, held in
      tenantry by a dense negro population, full of dilapidation and ruin; while
      on the other hand, there is the region of light, thin soils, occupied by
      the small white freeholder, filled with schools, churches, and good roads,
      and all the elements of a happy, enlightened country life.
    </p>

&sup1; The Census of 1880 gave proof of the superiority of the
     whites in cotton production. For purposes of comparison the
     cotton area may be divided into three regions: first, the
     Black Belt, in which the farmers were black, the soil
     fertile, the plantations large, the credit evil at its
     worst, and the yield of cotton per acre the least; second,
     the white districts, where the soil was the poorest, the
     farms small, the workers nearly all white, and the yield per
     acre better than on the fertile Black Belt lands; third, the
     regions in which the races were nearly equal in numbers or
     where the whites were in a slight majority, with soil of
     medium fertility, good methods of agriculture, and, owing to
     better controlled labor, the best yield. In other words,
     negroes, fertile soil, and poor crops went together; and on
     the other hand the whites got better crops on less fertile
     soil. The Black Belt has never again reached the level of
     production it had in 1860. But the white district kept
     improving slowly.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      All the systems devised for handling negro labor proved to be only
      partially successful. The laborer was migratory, wanted easy work, with
      one or two holidays a week, and the privilege of attending political
      meetings, camp meetings, and circuses. A thrifty negro could not make
      headway because his fellows stole from him or his less energetic relations
      and friends visited him and ate up
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
			his substance. One Alabama planter declared that he could not raise a
			turkey, a chicken, a hog, or a cow; and another asserted that "a hog has
			no more chance to live among these thieving negro farmers than a June bug
			in a gang of puddle ducks." Lands were mortgaged to the supply houses in
			the towns, the whites gradually deserted the country, and many rice and
			cotton fields grew up in weeds. Crop stealing at night became a business
			which no legislation could ever completely stop. </p>
			<p>A traveler has left the following description of "a model negro farm"
			in 1874. The farmer purchased an old mule on credit and rented land on
			shares or for so many bales of cotton; any old tools were used; corn,
			bacon, and other supplies were bought on credit, and a crop lien was
      given; a month later, corn and cotton were planted on soil that was not
      well broken up; the negro "would not pay for no guano" to put on other
      people's land; by turns the farmer planted and fished, plowed and hunted,
      hoed and frolicked, or went to "meeting." At the end of the year he sold
      his cotton, paid part of his rent and some of his debt, returned the mule
      to its owner, and sang:
    </p>
    <div class="poem">
      <p class="indent30 left-indent15">Nigger work hard all de year,</p>

    </div>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
      The great landholdings did not break up into small farms as was predicted,
      though sales were frequent and in 1865 enormous amounts of land were put
      on the market. After 1867, additional millions of acres were offered at
      small prices, and tax and mortgage sales were numerous. The result of
      these operations, however, was a change of landlords rather than a
      breaking up of large plantations. New men, negroes, merchants, and Jews
      became landowners. The number of small farms naturally increased but so in
      some instances did the land concentrated into large holdings.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was inevitable that conditions of negro life should undergo a
      revolutionary change during the reconstruction. The serious matter of
      looking out for himself and his family and of making a living dampened the
      negro's cheerful spirits. Released from the discipline of slavery and
      often misdirected by the worst of teachers, the negro race naturally ran
      into excesses of petty criminality. Even under the reconstruction
      governments the proportion of negro to white criminals was about ten to
      one. Theft was frequent; arson was the accepted means of revenge on white
      people; and murder became common in the brawls of the city negro quarters.
      The laxness of the marriage relation worked special
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
			hardship on the women and children in so many cases deserted by the head
			of the family.
    </p>
    <p>
      Out of the social anarchy of reconstruction the negroes emerged with
      numerous organizations of their own which may have been imitations of the
      Union League, the Lincoln Brotherhood, and the various church
      organizations. These societies were composed entirely of blacks and have
      continued with prolific reproduction to the present day. They were
      characterized by high names, gorgeous regalia, and frequent parades. "The
      Brothers and Sisters of Pleasure and Prosperity" and the "United Order of
      African Ladies and Gentlemen" played a large, and on the whole useful,
      part in negro social life, teaching lessons of thrift, insurance,
      co&ouml;peration, and mutual aid.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reconstructionists were not able in 1867-68 to carry through Congress
      any provision for the social equality of the races, but in the
      reconstructed States the equal rights issue was alive throughout the
      period. Legislation giving to the negro equal rights in hotels, places of
      amusements, and common carriers, was first enacted in Louisiana and South
      Carolina. Frequently the carpetbaggers brought up the issue in order to
      rid the radical ranks of the scalawags who were opposed to equal
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
			rights. In Florida, for example, the carpetbaggers framed a comprehensive
			Equal Rights Law, passed it, and presented it to Governor Reed, who was
			known to be opposed to such legislation. He vetoed the measure and thus
			lost the negro support. Intermarriage with whites was made legal in
			Louisiana and South Carolina and by court decision was permitted in
			Alabama and Mississippi, but the Georgia Supreme Court held it to be
			illegal. Mixed marriages were few, but these were made occasions of
			exultation over the whites and of consequent ill feeling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charles Sumner was a persistent agitator for equal rights. In 1871 he
      declared in a letter to a South Carolina negro convention that the race
      must insist not only upon equality in hotels and on public carriers but
      also in the schools. "It is not enough," he said, "to provide separate
      accommodations for colored citizens even if in all respects as good as
      those of other persons.&hellip; The discrimination is an insult and a
      hindrance, and a bar, which not only destroys comfort and prevents
      equality, but weakens all other rights. The right to vote will have new
      security when your equal right in public conveyances, hotels, and common
      schools, is at last established; but here you must
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
			insist for yourselves by speech, petition, and by vote." The Southern
			whites began to develop the "Jim Crow" theory of "separate but equal"
			accommodations. Senator Hill of Georgia, for example, thought that hotels
			might have separate divisions for the two races, and he cited the division
			in the churches as proof that the negro wanted separation.
    </p>
    <p>
      About 1874, it was plain that the last radical Congress was nearly ready
      to enact social equality legislation. This fact turned many of the
      Southern Unionist class back to the Democratic party, there to remain for
      a long time. In 1875, as a sort of memorial to Sumner, Congress passed the
      Civil Rights Act, which gave to negroes equal rights in hotels, places of
      amusement, on public carriers, and on juries. Some Democratic leaders were
      willing to see such legislation enacted, because in the first place, it
      would have little effect except in the Border and Northern States, where
      it would turn thousands into the Democratic fold, and in the second place,
      because they were sure that in time the Supreme Court would declare the
      law unconstitutional. And so it happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      In regions where the more unprincipled radical leaders were in control,
      the whites lived at times in fear of negro uprisings. The negroes were
      armed
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
			and insolent, and the whites were few and widely scattered. Here and
      there outbreaks occurred and individual whites and isolated families
      suffered, but as a rule all such movements were crushed with much heavier
      loss to the negroes than to the better organized whites. Nevertheless
      everlasting apprehension for the safety of women and children kept the
      white men nervous. General Garnett Andrews remarked about the situation in
      Mississippi:
    </p>
		<blockquote>
    <p class="noindent">
      I have never suffered such an amount of anguish and alarm in all my life.
      I have served through the whole war as a soldier in the army of Northern
      Virginia, and saw all of it; but I never did experience &hellip; the fear
			and alarm and sense of danger which I felt that time. And this was the
      universal feeling among the population, among the white people. I think
      that both sides were alarmed and felt uneasy. It showed itself upon the
      countenance of the people; it made many of them sick. Men looked haggard
      and pale, after undergoing this sort of thing for six weeks or a month,
      and I have felt when I laid [sic] down that neither myself, nor my wife
      and children were in safety. I expected, and honestly anticipated, and
      thought it highly probable, that I might be assassinated and my house set
      on fire at any time.
    </p>
		</blockquote>
    <p>
      By the fires of reconstruction the whites were fused into a more
      homogeneous society, social as well as political. The former slaveholding
      class
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">279</a></span>
			continued to be more considerate of the negro than were the poor
      whites; but, as misrule went on, all classes tended to unite against the
      negro in politics. They were tired of reconstruction, new amendments,
      force bills, Federal troops&mdash;tired of being ruled as conquered
      provinces by the incompetent and the dishonest. Every measure aimed at the
      South seemed to them to mean that they were considered incorrigible and
      unworthy of trust, and that they were being made to suffer for the deeds
      of irresponsible whites. And, to make matters worse, strong opposition to
      proscriptive measures was called fresh rebellion. "When the Jacobins say
      and do low and bitter things, their charge of want of loyalty in the South
      because our people grumble back a little seems to me as unreasonable as
      the complaint of the little boy: 'Mamma, make Bob 'have hisself. He makes
      mouths at me every time I hit him with my stick.'" &sup1;    </p>
		<div class="footer">

&sup1; Usually ascribed to General D.&nbsp;H. Hill of North Carolina,
     and quoted in <i>The Land We Love,</i> vol. 1, p. 146.</p>
</div>
    <p>
      Probably this burden fell heavier on the young men, who had life before
      them and who were growing up with diminished opportunities. Sidney Lanier,
      then an Alabama school-teacher, wrote to Bayard Taylor: "Perhaps you know
      that with us
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
			of the young generation in the South, since the war, pretty
      much the whole of life has been merely not dying." Negro and alien rule
      was a constant insult to the intelligence of the country. The taxpayers
      were nonparticipants in the affairs of government. Some people withdrew
      entirely from public life, went to their farms or plantations, kept away
      from towns and from speechmaking, waiting for the end to come. There were
      some who refused for several years to read the newspapers, so unpleasant
      was the news. The good feeling produced by the magnanimity of Grant at
      Appomattox was destroyed by the severity of his Southern policy when he
      became President. There was no gratitude for any so-called leniency of the
      North, no repentance for the war, no desire for humiliation, for sackcloth
      and ashes, and no confession of wrong. The insistence of the radicals upon
      obtaining a confession of depravity only made things much worse. Scarcely
      a measure of Congress during reconstruction was designed or received in a
      conciliatory spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The new generation of whites was poor, bitter because of persecution,
      ill educated, overworked, without a bright future, and shadowed by the
      race problem. Though their new political leaders were
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
			shrewd, narrow, conservative, honest, and parsimonious, the constant
			fighting of fire with fire scorched all. In the bitter discipline of
			reconstruction, the pleasantest side of Southern life came to an end.
			During the war and the consequent reconstruction there was a marked
			change in Southern temperament toward the severe. Hospitality declined;
			the old Southern life had never been on a business basis, but the new
			Southern life now adjusted itself to a stricter economy; the old
			individuality was partially lost; but class distinctions were less
			obvious in a more homogeneous society. The material evils of
			reconstruction may be only temporary; state debts may be paid and
			wasted resources renewed; but the moral and intellectual results of
			the revolution will be the more permanent.

      radical program of reconstruction ended after ten years in failure
      rather because of a change in public opinion in the North than because of
      the resistance of the Southern whites. The North of 1877, indeed, was not
      the North of 1867. A more tolerant attitude toward the South developed as
      the North passed through its own period of misgovernment when all the
      large cities were subject to "ring rule" and corruption, as in New York
      under "Boss" Tweed and in the District of Columbia under "Boss" Shepherd.
      The Federal civil service was discredited by the scandals connected with
      the Sanborn contracts, the Whisky Ring, and the Star Routes, while some
      leaders in Congress were under a cloud from the "Salary Grab" and Credit
      Mobilier disclosures. &sup1;

      The marvelous material development of the North and West also drew
      attention away from sectional controversies. Settlers poured into the
      plains beyond the Mississippi and the valleys of the Far West; new
      industries sprang up; unsuspected mineral wealth was discovered; railroads
      were built. Not only bankers but taxpaying voters took an interest in the
      financial readjustments of the time. Many thousand people followed the
      discussions over the funding and refunding of the national debt, the
      retirement of the greenbacks, and the proposed lowering of tariff duties.
      Yet the Black Friday episode of 1869, when Jay Gould and James Fisk
      cornered the visible supply of gold, and the panic of 1873 were
      indications of unsound financial conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      These new developments and the new domestic problems which they involved
      all tended to divert public thought from the old political issues arising
      out of the war. Foreign relations, too, began to take on a new interest.
      The <i>Alabama</i> claims controversy with England continued to hold the
			public attention until finally settled by the Geneva Arbitration in 1872.
      President Grant, as much of an expansionist as Seward, for two years
      (1869-71) tried to secure Santo Domingo or a part of it for an
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
			American naval base in the West Indies. But the United States had race
			problems enough already and the Senate, led by Sumner, refused to
			sanction the acquisition. Relations with Spain were frequently strained
			on account of American filibustering expeditions to aid Cuban insurgents.
			Spain repeatedly charged the United States with laxness toward such
			violations of international law; and President Grant, seeing no other
			way out, recommended in 1869 and again in 1870 that the Cuban insurgents
			be recognized as belligerents, but still the Senate held back. The climax
      came in 1873, when the Spanish authorities in Cuba captured on the high
      seas the <i>Virginius</i> &sup1; with a filibustering expedition on board
			and executed fifty-three of the crew and passengers, among them eight
			Americans. For a time war seemed imminent, but Spain acted quickly and
			effected a peaceable settlement.

    <p>
      It became evident soon after 1867 that the issues involved in
      reconstruction were not in themselves sufficient to hold the North solidly
      Republican. Toward negro suffrage, for example, Northern public opinion
      was on the whole unfriendly. In 1867 the negro was permitted to vote only
      in New York
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
			and in New England, except in Connecticut. Before 1869 negro
      suffrage was rejected in Connecticut, Wisconsin, Kansas, Ohio, Maryland,
      Missouri, Michigan, and Minnesota. The Republicans in their national
      platform of 1868 went only so far as to say that, while negro suffrage was
      to be forced upon the South, it must remain a local question in the North.
      The Border States rapidly lined up with the white South on matters of
      race, church, and politics.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not until 1874, however, that the changing opinion was made
      generally effective in the elections. The skillfully managed radical
      organization held large majorities in every Congress from the Thirty-ninth
      to the Forty-third, and the electoral votes in 1868 and 1872 seemed to
      show that the conservative opposition was insignificant. But these figures
      do not tell the whole story. Even in 1864, when Lincoln won by nearly half
      a million, the popular vote was as eighteen to twenty-two, and four years
      later Grant, the most popular man in the United States, had a majority of
      only three hundred thousand over Seymour, and this majority and more came
      from the new negro voters. Four years later with about a million negro
      voters available and an opposition not pleased with its own
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
      candidate, Grant's majority reached only seven hundred thousand. At no
			one time in elections did the North pronounce itself in favor of all the
      reconstruction policies. The break, signs of which were visible as early
      as 1869, came in 1874 when the Republicans lost control of the House of
      Representatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strength was given to the opposition because of the dissatisfaction with
      President Grant, who knew little about politics and politicians. He felt
      that his Cabinet should be made up of personal friends, not of strong
      advisers, and that the military ideal of administration was the proper
      one. He was faithful but undiscriminating in his friendships and
      frequently chose as his associates men of vulgar tastes and low motives;
      and he showed a na&iuml;ve love of money and an undisguised admiration
			for rich men such as Gould and Fisk. His appointees were often incompetent
			friends or relatives, and his cynical attitude toward civil service reform
			lost him the support of influential men. When forced by party exigencies
			to select first-class men for his Cabinet, he still preferred to go for
      advice to practical politicians. On the Southern question he easily fell
      under control of the radicals, who in order to retain their influence had
      only to convince
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
			his military mind that the South was again in rebellion, and who found
			it easy to distract public opinion from political corruption by
			"waving the bloody shirt." Dissatisfaction with his Administration, it
      is true, was confined to the intellectuals, the reformers, and the
      Democrats, but they were strong enough to defeat him for a second term if
      they could only be organized.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Liberal Republican movement began in the West about 1869 with demands
      for amnesty and for reform, particularly in the civil service, and it soon
      spread rapidly over the North. When it became certain that the "machine"
      would renominate Grant, the liberal movement became an anti-Grant party.
      The "New Departure" Democrats gave comfort and prospect of aid to the
      Liberal Republicans by declaring for a constructive, forward-looking
      policy in place of reactionary opposition. The Liberal chiefs were led to
      believe that the new Democratic leaders would accept their platform and
      candidates in order to defeat Grant. The principal candidates for the
      Liberal Republican nomination were Charles Francis Adams, Lyman Trumbull,
      Gratz Brown, David Davis, and Horace Greeley. Adams was the strongest
      candidate but was jockeyed out of place and the nomination was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
			given to Horace Greeley, able enough as editor of the <i>New York
			Tribune</i> but impossible as a candidate for the presidency. The
			Democratic party accepted him as their candidate also, although he had
			been a lifelong opponent of Democratic principles and policies. But
			disgusted Liberals either returned to the Republican ranks or stayed away
			from the polls, and many Democrats did likewise. Under these circumstances
			the re&euml;lection of Grant was a foregone conclusion. There was
			certainly a potential majority against Grant, but the opposition had
			failed to organize, while the Republican machine was in good working
			order, the negroes were voting, and the Enforcement Acts proved a great
			aid to the Republicans in the Southern States.
    </p>
    <p>
      One good result of the growing liberal sentiment was the passage of an
      Amnesty Act by Congress on May 22, 1872. By statute and by the Fourteenth
      Amendment, Congress had refused to recognize the complete validity of
      President Johnson's pardons and amnesty proclamations, and all Confederate
      leaders who wished to regain political rights had therefore to appeal to
      Congress. During the Forty-first Congress (1869-71) more than three
      thousand Southerners were amnestied in order that they might hold office.
      These, however, were
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span>
			for the most part scalawags; the most respectable whites would not seek
			an amnesty which they could secure only by self-stultification. &sup1; It
			was the pressure of public opinion against white disfranchisement and the
			necessity for meeting the Liberal Republican arguments which caused the
			passage of the Act of 1872. By this act about 150,000 whites were
			re&euml;nfranchised, leaving out only about five hundred of the most
			prominent of the old r&eacute;gime, most of whom were never restored to
      citizenship. Both Robert E. Lee and Jefferson Davis died disfranchised.

&sup1; The machinery of government and politics was all in
     radical hands&mdash;the carpetbaggers and scalawags, who were
     numerous enough to fill practically all the offices. These
     men were often able leaders and skillful managers, and they
     did not intend to surrender control; and the black race was
     obedient and furnished the votes. In 1868, with Virginia,
     Mississippi, Georgia, and Texas unrepresented, the first
     radical contingent in Congress from the South numbered 42,
     of whom 10 out of 12 senators and 26 out of 32
     representatives were carpetbaggers. There were two lone
     conservative Congressmen. A few months later, in 1869, there
     were 64 radical representatives from the South, 20 senators
     and 44 members of the House of Representatives. In 1877 this
     number had dwindled to two senators and four
     representatives. The difference between these figures
     measures in some degree the extent of the undoing of
     reconstruction within the period of Grant's Administration.</p>

    <p>
      How the Southern whites escaped from negro domination has often been told
      and may here be sketched only in outline. The first States regained
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
			from radicalism were those in which the negro population was small and the
      black vote large enough to irritate but not to dominate. Although Northern
      sentiment, excited by the stories of "Southern outrage," was then
      unfavorable, the conservatives of the South, by organizing a "white man's
      party" and by the use of Ku Klux methods, made a fight for social safety
      which they won nearly everywhere, and, in addition, they gained political
      control of several States&mdash;Tennessee in 1869, Virginia in 1869-1870,
      and North Carolina and Georgia in 1870. They almost won Louisiana in 1868
      and Alabama in 1870, but the alarmed radicals came to the rescue of the
      situation with the Fifteenth Amendment and the Enforcement Laws of
      1870-1871. With more troops and a larger number of deputy marshals it
      seemed that the radicals might securely hold the remaining States. Arrests
      of conservatives were numerous, plundering was at its height, the Federal
      Government was interested and was friendly to the new Southern rulers, and
      the carpetbaggers and scalawags feasted, troubled only by the disposition
      of their negro supporters to demand a share of the spoils. Although the
      whites made little gain from 1870 to 1874, the States already rescued
      became more firmly conservative;
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">291</a></span>
			white counties here and there in the black States voted out the radicals;
			a few more representatives of the whites got into Congress; and the Border
			States ranged themselves more solidly with the conservatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      But while the Southern whites were becoming desperate under oppression,
      public opinion in the North was at last beginning to affect politics. The
      elections of 1874 resulted in a Democratic landslide of which the
      Administration was obliged to take notice. Grant now grew more responsive
      to criticism. In 1875 he replied to a request for troops to hold down
      Mississippi: "The whole public are tired out with these annual autumnal
      outbreaks in the South and the great majority are ready now to condemn any
      interference on the part of the Government." As soon as conditions in the
      South were better understood in the North, ready sympathy and political
      aid were offered by many who had hitherto acted with the radicals. The Ku
      Klux report as well as the newspaper writings and the books of J.&nbsp;S.
			Pike and Charles Nordhoff, both former opponents of slavery, opened the
			eyes of many to the evil results of negro suffrage. Some who had been
			considered friends of the negro, now believing that he had proven to
			be a political failure,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
			coldly abandoned him and turned their altruistic interests to other
			objects more likely to succeed. Many real friends of the negro were
      alarmed at the evils of the reconstruction and were anxious to see the
      corrupt political leaders deprived of further influence over the race. To
      others the constantly recurring Southern problem was growing stale and
      they desired to hear less of it. Within the Republican party in each
      Southern State there were serious divisions over the spoils. First it was
      carpetbagger and negro against the scalawag; later, when the black leaders
      insisted that those who furnished the votes must have the larger share of
      the rewards, the fight became triangular. As a result, by 1874 the
      Republican party in the South was split into factions and was deserted by
      a large proportion of its white membership.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conservative whites, fiercely resentful after their experiences under
      the enforcement laws and hopeful of Northern sympathy, now planned a
      supreme effort to regain their former power. Race lines were more strictly
      drawn; ostracism of all that was radical became the rule; the Republican
      party in the South, it was apparent, was doomed to be only a negro party
      weighed down by the scandal of bad government; the state treasuries were
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span>
      bankrupt, and there was little further opportunity for plunder. These
      considerations had much to do with the return of scalawags to the "white
      man's party" and the retirement of carpetbaggers from Southern politics.
      There was no longer anything in it, they said; let the negro have it!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was under these conditions that the "white man's party" carried the
      elections in Alabama, Arkansas, and Texas in 1874, and Mississippi in
      1875. Asserting that it was a contest between civilization and barbarism,
      and that the whites under the radical r&eacute;gime had no opportunity to
			carry an election legally, the conservatives openly made use of every
			method of influencing the result that could possibly come within the
			radical law and they even employed many effective methods that lay outside
			the law. Negroes were threatened with discharge from employment and whites
			with tar and feathers if they voted the radical ticket; there were
			night-riding parties, armed and drilled "white leagues," and mysterious
			firing of guns and cannon at night; much plain talk assailed the ears of
			the radical leaders; and several bloody outbreaks occurred, principally in
			Louisiana and Mississippi. Louisiana had been carried by the Democrats in
			the fall of 1872, but the radical returning board had
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
			reversed the election. In 1874 the whites rose in rebellion and turned out
			Kellogg, the usurping Governor, but President Grant intervened to restore
			him to office. The "Mississippi" or "shot-gun plan" &sup1; was very
			generally employed, except where the contest was likely to go in favor of
			the whites without the use of undue pressure. The white leaders exercised
			a moderating influence, but the average white man had determined to do
			away with negro government even though the alternative might be a return
			of military rule. Congress investigated the elections in each State which
			overthrew the reconstructionists, but nothing came of the inquiry and the
			population rapidly settled down into good order. After 1875 only three
			States were left under radical government&mdash;Louisiana and Florida,
			where the returning boards could throw out any Democratic majority, and
			South Carolina, where the negroes greatly outnumbered the whites.

    <p>
      Reconstruction could hardly be a genuine issue in the presidential
      campaign of 1876, because all except these three reconstructed States had
      escaped from radical control, and there was no hope and
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span>
			little real desire of regaining them. It was even expected that in this
			year the radicals would lose Louisiana and Florida to the "white man's
			party." The leaders of the best element of the Republicans, both North
			and South, looked upon the reconstruction as one of the prime causes of
			the moral breakdown of their party; they wanted no more of the Southern
			issue but planned a forward-looking, constructive reform.
    </p>
    <p>
      To some of the Republican leaders, however, among whom was James G.
			Blaine, it was clear that the Republican party, with its unsavory record
			under Grant's Administration, could hardly go before the people with a
			reform program. The only possible thing to do was to revive some Civil War
			issue&mdash;"wave the bloody shirt" and fan the smoldering embers of
			sectional feeling. Blaine met with complete success in raising the desired
			issue. In January 1876, when an amnesty measure was brought before the
			House, he moved that Jefferson Davis be excepted on the ground that he was
			responsible for the mistreatment of Union prisoners during the war.
			Southern hot-bloods replied, and Blaine skillfully led them on until they
			had foolishly furnished him with ample material for campaign purposes.
			The feeling thus
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
      aroused was so strong that it even galvanized into seeming life the dying
      interest in the wrongs of the negro. The rallying cry "Vote as you shot!"
      gave the Republicans something to fight for; the party referred to its war
      record, claimed credit for preserving the Union, emancipating the negro,
      and reconstructing the South, and demanded that the country be not
      "surrendered to rebel rule."
    </p>
    <p>
      Hayes and Tilden, the rival candidates for the presidency, were both men
      of high character and of moderate views. Their nominations had been forced
      by the better element of each party. Hayes, the Republican candidate, had
      been a good soldier, was moderate in his views on Southern questions, and
      had a clean political reputation. Tilden, his opponent, had a good record
      as a party man and as a reformer, and his party needed only to attack the
      past record of the Republicans. The principal Democratic weakness lay in
      the fact that the party drew so much of its strength from the white South
      and was therefore subjected to criticism on Civil War issues.
    </p>
    <p>
      The campaign was hotly contested and was conducted on a low plane. Even
      Hayes soon saw that the "bloody shirt" issue was the main vote winner. The
      whites of the three "unredeemed" Southern
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
			States nerved themselves for the final struggle. In South Carolina and in
			some parishes of Louisiana there was a considerable amount of violence,
			in which the whites had the advantage, and much fraud, which the
			Republicans, who controlled the election machinery, turned to best
			account. It has been said that out of the confusion which the Republicans
			created they won the presidency.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first election returns seemed to give Tilden the victory with 184
      undisputed electoral votes and popular majorities of ninety and over six
      thousand respectively in Florida and Louisiana; only 185 votes were needed
      for a choice. Hayes had 166 votes, not counting Oregon, in which one vote
      was in dispute, and South Carolina, which for a time was claimed by both
      parties. Had Louisiana and Florida been Northern States, there would have
      been no controversy, but the Republican general headquarters knew that the
      Democratic majorities in these States had to go through Republican
      returning boards, which had never yet failed to throw them out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The interest of the nation now centered around the action of the two
      returning boards. At the suggestion of President Grant, prominent
      Republicans went South to witness the count. Later
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
			prominent Democrats went also. These "visiting statesmen" were to support
			the frail returning boards in their duty. It was generally understood that
			these boards, certainly the one in Louisiana, were for sale, and there is
			little doubt that the Democrats inquired the price. But they were afraid
			to bid on such uncertain quantities as Governor Wells and T.&nbsp;C.
			Anderson of Louisiana, both notorious spoilsmen. The members of the boards
			in both States soon showed the stiffening effect of the moral support of
			the Federal Administration and of the "visiting statesmen." Reassured as
			to their political future, they proceeded to do their duty: in Florida
			they threw out votes until the ninety majority for Tilden was changed to
			925 for Hayes, and in Louisiana, by throwing out about fifteen thousand
			carefully selected ballots, they changed Tilden's lowest majority of six
			thousand to a Hayes majority of nearly four thousand. Naturally the
			Democrats sent in contesting returns, but the presidency was really won
			when the Republicans secured in Louisiana and Florida returns which were
			regular in form. But hoping to force Congress to go behind the returns,
			the Democrats carried up contests also from Oregon and South Carolina,
			whose votes properly belonged to Hayes.
    </p>
    <p>
		  <span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
      The final contest came in Congress over the counting of the electoral
      votes. The Constitution provides that "the President of the Senate shall,
      in the presence of the Senate and the House of Representatives, open all
      the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted." But there was no
      agreement as to where authority lay for deciding disputed votes. Never
      before had the presidency turned on a disputed count. From 1864 to 1874
      the "twenty-second joint rule" had been in force under which either House
      might reject a certificate. The votes of Georgia in 1868 and of Louisiana
      in 1872 had thus been thrown out. But the rule had not been readopted by
      the present Congress, and the Republicans very naturally would not listen
      to a proposal to readopt it now.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the country apparently on the verge of civil war, Congress finally
      created by law an Electoral Commission to which were to be referred all
      disputes about the counting of votes and the decision of which was to be
      final unless both Houses concurred in rejecting it. The act provided that
      the commission should consist of five senators, five representatives, four
      designated associate justices of the Supreme Court, and a fifth associate
      justice to be chosen by these four. While nothing was
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
			said in the act
      about the political affiliations of the members of the commission, every
      one understood that the House would select three Democrats and two
      Republicans, and that the Senate would name two Democrats and three
      Republicans. It was also well known that of the four justices designated
      two were Republicans and two Democrats, and it was tacitly agreed that the
      fifth would be Justice David Davis, an "independent." But at the last
      moment Davis was elected Senator by the Illinois Legislature and declined
      to serve on the Commission. Justice Bradley, a Republican, was then named
      as the fifth justice, and in this way the Republicans obtained a majority
      on the Commission.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Democrats deserve the credit for the Electoral Commission. The
      Republicans did not favor it, even after they were sure of a party
      majority on it. They were conscious that they had a weak case, and they
      were afraid to trust it to judges of the Supreme Court. Their fears were
      groundless, however, since all important questions were decided by an 8 to
      7 vote, Bradley voting with his fellow Republicans. Every contested vote
      was given to Hayes, and with 185 electoral votes he was declared elected
      on March 2, 1877.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten years before, Senator Morton of Indiana had
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
			said: "I would have been in favor of having the colored people of the
			South wait a few years until they were prepared for the suffrage, until
			they were to some extent educated, but the necessities of the times
			forbade that; the conditions of things required that they should be
			brought to the polls at once." Now the condition of things required that
			some arrangement be made with the Southern whites which would involve a
			complete reversal of the situation of 1867. In order to secure the
			unopposed succession of Hayes, to defeat filibustering which might
			endanger the decision of the Electoral Commission, politicians who could
			speak with authority for Hayes assured influential Southern politicians,
			who wanted no more civil war but who did want home rule, that an
			arrangement might be made which would be satisfactory to both sides.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the contest was ended. Hayes was to be President; the South, with the
      negro, was to be left to the whites; there would be no further military
      aid to carpetbag governments. In so far as the South was concerned, it was
      a fortunate settlement&mdash;better, indeed, than if Tilden had been
			inducted into office. The remnants of the reconstruction policy were
			surrendered by a Republican President,
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">302</a></span>
			the troops were soon withdrawn, and the three radical States fell at once
			under the control of the whites. Hayes could not see in his election any
			encouragement to adopt a vigorous radical position, and Congress was
			deadlocked on party issues for fifteen years. As a result the radical
			Republicans had to develop other interests, and the North gradually
			accepted the Southern situation.
    </p>
		<hr class="break" />
    <p>
      Although the radical policy of reconstruction came to an end in 1877, some
      of its results were more lasting. The Southern States were burdened
      heavily with debt, much of which had been fraudulently incurred. There now
      followed a period of adjustment, of refunding, scaling, and repudiation,
      which not only injured the credit of the States but left them with
      enormous debts. The Democratic party under the leadership of former
      Confederates began its r&eacute;gime of strict economy, race fairness,
			and inelastic Jeffersonianism. There was a political rest which almost
      amounted to stagnation and which the leaders were unwilling to disturb by
      progressive measures lest a developing democracy make trouble with the
      settlement of 1877.
    </p>
    <p>
      The undoing of reconstruction was not entirely completed with the
      understanding of 1877. There
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">303</a></span>
			remained a large but somewhat shattered Republican party in the South,
			with control over county and local government in many negro districts.
			Little by little the Democrats rooted out these last vestiges of negro
			control, using all the old radical methods and some improvements,&sup1;
			such as tissue ballots, the shuffling of ballot boxes, bribery, force,
			and redistricting, while some regions were placed entirely under
			executive control and were ruled by appointed commissions. With the
			good government which followed these changes a deadlocked Congress
			showed no great desire to interfere. The Supreme Court came to the aid
			of the Democrats with decisions in 1875, 1882, and 1883 which drew the
			teeth from the Enforcement Laws, and Congress in 1894 repealed what
			was left of these regulations.

</div>


    <p>
      Under such discouraging conditions the voting strength of the Republicans
      rapidly melted away. The party organization existed for the Federal
      offices only and was interested in keeping down the number of those who
      desired to be rewarded. As a consequence, the leaders could work in
      harmony with those Democratic chiefs who were content with a "solid South"
      and local home rule. The negroes
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">304</a></span>
			of the Black Belt, with less enthusiasm and hope, but with quite the same
			docility as in 1868, began to vote as the Democratic leaders directed.
			This practice brought up in another form the question of "negro
			government" and resulted in a demand from the people of the white counties
			that the negro be put entirely out of politics. The answer came between
			1890 to 1902 in the form of new and complicated election laws or new
			constitutions which in various ways shut out the negro from the polls and
			left the government to the whites. Three times have the Black Belt regions
			dominated the Southern States: under slavery, when the master class
			controlled; under reconstruction, when the leaders of the negroes had
			their own way; and after reconstruction until negro disfranchisement,
			when the Democratic dictators of the negro vote ruled fairly but not
			always acceptably to the white counties which are now the source of their
			political power.

      Mississippi</i> (1901), W.&nbsp;L. Fleming's <i>Civil War and
			Reconstruction in Alabama</i> (1905), J.&nbsp;G. deR. Hamilton's
			<i>Reconstruction in North Carolina</i> (1914), W.&nbsp;W. Davis's
			<i>The Civil War and Reconstruction in Florida</i> (1913), J.&nbsp;S.
			Reynolds's <i>Reconstruction in South Carolina, 1865-1877</i> (1905);
			C.&nbsp;W. Ramsdell's <i>Reconstruction in Texas</i> (1910), and
			C.&nbsp;M. Thompson's <i>Reconstruction in Georgia</i> (1915).
    </p>
    <p>
      Books of interest on special phases of reconstruction are not numerous,
      but among those deserving mention are Paul S. Pierce's <i>The Freedmen's
      Bureau</i> (1904), D.&nbsp;M. DeWitt's <i>The Impeachment and Trial of
			Andrew Johnson</i> (1903), and Paul L. Haworth's <i>The Hayes-Tilden
			Disputed Presidential Election of 1876</i> (1906), each of which is a
			thorough study of its field. J.&nbsp;C. Lester and D.&nbsp;L. Wilson's
			<i>Ku Klux Klan</i> (1905) and M.&nbsp;L. Avary's <i>Dixie After the
			War</i> (1906) contribute much to a fair understanding of the feeling of
			the whites after the Civil War; and Gideon Welles, <i>Diary,</i> 3 vols.
			(1911), is a mine of information from a conservative cabinet officer's
			point of view.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the politician's point of view one may go to James G. Blaine's
			<i>Twenty Years of Congress,</i> 2 vols. (1884, 1886) and Samuel S.
			Cox's <i>Three Decades of Federal Legislation</i> (1885). Good
			biographies are James A. Woodburn's <i>The Life of Thaddeus Stevens</i>
			(1913), Moorfield Storey's <i>Charles Sumner</i> (1900), C.&nbsp;F.
			Adams's <i>Charles Francis Adams</i> (1900). Less satisfactory because
			more partisan is Edward Stanwood's <i>James
			<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">307</a></span>
      Gillespie Blaine</i> (1906). There are no adequate biographies of the
      Democratic and Southern leaders.
    </p>
    <p>
      The official documents are found conveniently arranged in William
      McDonald's <i>Select Statutes, 1861-1898</i> (1903), and also with other
      material in Walter L. Fleming's <i>Documentary History of
			Reconstruction,</i> 2 vols. (1906, 1907). The general reader is usually
			repelled by the collections known as <i>Public Documents.</i> The
			valuable <i>Ku Klux Trials</i> (1872) is, however, separately printed
			and to be found in most good libraries. By a judicious use of the
			indispensable <i>Tables and Index to Public Documents,</i> one can find
			much vividly interesting material in connection with contested election
			cases and reports of congressional investigations into conditions in the
			South.

Welcome to <span class="PG">Project Gutenberg's</span> edition of
<i>Sequel to Appomattox</i> by Walter Fleming in the <i>Chronicles of
America</i> series.  The images were courtesy of the Abraham Lincoln
Edition on the internet archive from the University of Michigan.
We also consulted the textbook edition from the Internet Archive
to produce an e-book without images.</p>
<p>The images have been moved so that they do not break up paragraphs
and so that they are next to the text that they illustrate. The page
number of the illustration might not match the page number in the List
of Illustrations.</p>

<p>We have made the following emendations to the text:
</p>

<p><br /></p>
<h4>Index:</h4>
<p>
   On <a href="#Page_313">Page 313</a>, Re-election is transcribed as
	 re&euml;lection.
</p>

<p>
   On <a href="#Page_321">Page 321</a>, Tourg&eacute;e is spelled without the
	 acute accent, but the entry refers to a passage in the text where
	 the acute accent is used.  We put the accent on the entry in the index.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works to
protect the <span class="PG">Project Gutenberg</span>&trade;
concept and trademark.  Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission.  If you do not charge anything for copies of
this eBook, complying with the rules is very easy.  You may use this
eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works,
reports, performances and research.  They may be modified and printed
and given away&mdash;you may do practically <em>anything</em> with
public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is subject to the trademark
license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

*** START: FULL LICENSE ***</p>
<p class="section-heading">THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE</p>
<p><em>Please read this before you distribute or use this work.</em></p>

<p>To protect the Project Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).</p>

<p class="section-heading">
Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic works</p>

<p>
1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>

<p>
1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.</p>

<p>
1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg&trade; mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg&trade; works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg&trade; name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg&trade; License when you share it without charge with others.</p>

<p>
1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg&trade; work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.</p>

<p>
1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>

<p>
1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg&trade; License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:</p>

<p>
This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net.</p>

<p>
1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.</p>

<p>
1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg &trade; License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>

<p>
1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&trade;.</p>

<p>
1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; License.</p>

<p>
1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&trade; work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg&trade; web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>

<p>
1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg&trade; works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>

<p>
1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works provided
that</p>

<ul>
<li> You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg&trade; works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."</li>
<li> You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&trade;
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg &trade; works.</li>
<li> You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.</li>
<li> You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; works.</li>
</ul>

<p>
1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg&trade;
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg&trade; trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>

<p>1.F.</p>

<p>
1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg&trade;
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.</p>

<p>
1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES: Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&trade; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&trade; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  <i>You agree that you have no remedies for negligence, strict
liability, breach of warranty or breach of contract except those
provided in Paragraph F3.  You agree that the Foundation, the
trademark owner, and any distributor under this agreement will not be
liable to you for actual, direct, indirect, consequential, punitive or
incidental damages even if you give notice of the possibility of such
damage. </i>
</p>

<p>
1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND: If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.</p>

<p>
1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', <em>with no other
warranties of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to
warranties of merchantibility or fitness for any purpose.</em>
</p>

<p>
1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>

<p>
1.F.6.  INDEMNITY: You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg&trade;
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg&trade; work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>

<p class="section-heading">
Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&trade;</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg &trade; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg's&trade;
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&trade; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&trade; and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.</p>

<p class="section-heading">
Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation</p>

<p>
The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service.  The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at

<p class="section-heading">
Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
<em>send donations</em> or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org.</p>

<p>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>
Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate.</p>

<p class="section-heading">
Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg&trade; electronic
works.</p>

<p>
Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg&trade;
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg&trade; eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>

<p>
Project Gutenberg&trade; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:</p>
<p class="file-location">http://www.gutenberg.net</p>

<p>
